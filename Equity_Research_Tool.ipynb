Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the\\n\\nNorth-Western Provinces and\\n\\nAwadh (Oudh). The East India Company\\'s response came rapidly as well.

The victory was consolidated in 1764 at the Battle of Buxar, when the East India Company army defeated Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II. After his defeat, the emperor granted the company the right to the \"collection of Revenue\" in the provinces of Bengal (modern day Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha), known as \"Diwani\" to the company.[25] The Company soon expanded its territories around its bases in Bombay and Madras; later, the Anglo-Mysore Wars (1766–1799) and the Anglo-Maratha Wars (1772–1818) led to control of even more of India.[26]\\n\\nIn 1806, the Vellore Mutiny was sparked by new uniform regulations that created resentment amongst both Hindu and Muslim sepoys.[27]\\n\\nWellesley began what became two decades of accelerated expansion of Company territories. This was achieved either by\\n\\nsubsidiary alliances between the company and local rulers or by direct military annexation.\\n\\n[28]\\n\\nprincely states of the Hindu\\n\\nmaharajas and the Muslim\\n\\nnawabs.\\n\\nPunjab,\\n\\nNorth-West Frontier Province, and\\n\\nKashmir were annexed after the\\n\\nSecond Anglo-Sikh War in 1849; however, Kashmir was immediately sold under the\\n\\n1846 Treaty of Amritsar to the\\n\\nDogra Dynasty of\\n\\nJammu and thereby became a princely state. The border dispute between\\n\\nNepal and British India, which sharpened after 1801, had caused the\\n\\nAnglo-Nepalese War of 1814–16 and brought the defeated\\n\\nGurkhas under British influence. In 1854,\\n\\nBerar was annexed, and the state of Oudh was added two years later. For practical purposes, the company was the government of much of India.\\n\\ncitation needed\\n\\nCauses of the rebellion\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nCauses of the Indian Rebellion of 1857\\n\\nThe Indian Rebellion of 1857 occurred as the result of an accumulation of factors over time, rather than any single event.[citation needed]\\n\\nsepoys\\n\\npresidency armies:\\n\\nBombay,\\n\\nMadras, and\\n\\nBengal. The\\n\\nBengal Army recruited higher\\n\\ncastes, such as\\n\\nBrahmins,\\n\\nRajputs and\\n\\nBhumihar, mostly from the\\n\\nAwadh and\\n\\nBihar regions, and even restricted the enlistment of lower castes in 1855.\\n\\n[29]\\n\\nMadras Army and\\n\\nBombay Army were \"more localized, caste-neutral armies\" that \"did not prefer high-caste men\".\\n\\n[30]\\n\\ncitation needed\\n\\nIn 1772, when Warren Hastings was appointed Fort William\\'s first Governor-General, one of his first undertakings was the rapid expansion of the company\\'s army. Since the sepoys from Bengal – many of whom had fought against the Company in the Battles of Plassey and Buxar – were now suspect in British eyes, Hastings recruited farther west from the high-caste rural Rajputs and Bhumihar of Awadh and Bihar, a practice that continued for the next 75 years. However, in order to forestall any social friction, the company also took action to adapt its military practices to the requirements of their religious rituals. Consequently, these soldiers dined in separate facilities; in addition, overseas service, considered polluting to their caste, was not required of them, and the army soon came officially to recognise Hindu festivals. \"This encouragement of high caste ritual status, however, left the government vulnerable to protest, even mutiny, whenever the sepoys detected infringement of their prerogatives.\"[31] Stokes argues that \"The British scrupulously avoided interference with the social structure of the village community which remained largely intact.\"[32]\\n\\nAfter the annexation of Oudh (Awadh) by the East India Company in 1856, many sepoys were disquieted both from losing their perquisites, as landed gentry, in the Oudh courts, and from the anticipation of any increased land-revenue payments that the annexation might bring about.[33] Other historians have stressed that by 1857, some Indian soldiers, interpreting the presence of missionaries as a sign of official intent, were convinced that the company was masterminding mass conversions of Hindus and Muslims to Christianity.[34] Although earlier in the 1830s, evangelicals such as William Carey and William Wilberforce had successfully clamoured for the passage of social reform, such as the abolition of sati and allowing the remarriage of Hindu widows, there is little evidence that the sepoys\\' allegiance was affected by this.[33]\\n\\nHowever, changes in the terms of their professional service may have created resentment. As the extent of the East India Company\\'s jurisdiction expanded with victories in wars or annexation, the soldiers were now expected not only to serve in less familiar regions, such as in Burma, but also to make do without the \"foreign service\" remuneration that had previously been their due.[35]\\n\\nA major cause of resentment that arose ten months prior to the outbreak of the rebellion was the General Service Enlistment Act of 25 July 1856. As noted above, men of the Bengal Army had been exempted from overseas service. Specifically, they were enlisted only for service in territories to which they could march. Governor-General Lord Dalhousie saw this as an anomaly, since all sepoys of the Madras and Bombay Armies and the six \"General Service\" battalions of the Bengal Army had accepted an obligation to serve overseas if required. As a result, the burden of providing contingents for active service in Burma, readily accessible only by sea, and China had fallen disproportionately on the two smaller Presidency Armies. As signed into effect by Lord Canning, Dalhousie\\'s successor as Governor-General, the act required only new recruits to the Bengal Army to accept a commitment for general service. However, serving high-caste sepoys were fearful that it would be eventually extended to them, as well as preventing sons following fathers into an army with a strong tradition of family service.[36]:\\u200a261\\n\\nThere were also grievances over the issue of promotions, based on seniority. This, as well as the increasing number of British officers in the battalions,[37][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed] made promotion slow, and many Indian officers did not reach commissioned rank until they were too old to be effective.[38]\\n\\nThe Enfield rifle\\n\\nThe final spark was provided by the ammunition for the new Enfield Pattern 1853 rifled musket.[39] These rifles, which fired Minié balls, had a tighter fit than the earlier muskets, and used paper cartridges that came pre-greased. To load the rifle, sepoys had to bite the cartridge open to release the powder.[40] The grease used on these cartridges was rumoured to include tallow derived from beef, which would be offensive to Hindus,[41] and lard derived from pork, which would be offensive to Muslims. At least one Company official pointed out the difficulties this might cause:\\n\\nunless it be proven that the grease employed in these cartridges is not of a nature to offend or interfere with the prejudices of religion, it will be expedient not to issue them for test to Native corps.[42]\\n\\nHowever, in August 1856, greased cartridge production was initiated at Fort William, Calcutta, following a British design. The grease used included tallow supplied by the Indian firm of Gangadarh Banerji & Co.[43] By January, rumours abounded that the Enfield cartridges were greased with animal fat.[citation needed]\\n\\nCompany officers became aware of the rumours through reports of an altercation between a high-caste sepoy and a low-caste labourer at Dum Dum.[44] The labourer had taunted the sepoy that by biting the cartridge, he had himself lost caste, although at this time such cartridges had been issued only at Meerut and not at Dum Dum.[45] There had been rumours that the British sought to destroy the religions of the Indian people, and forcing the native soldiers to break their sacred code would have certainly added to this rumour, as it apparently did. The company was quick to reverse the effects of this policy in hopes that the unrest would be quelled.[46][47]\\n\\nOn 27 January, Colonel Richard Birch, the Military Secretary, ordered that all cartridges issued from depots were to be free from grease, and that sepoys could grease them themselves using whatever mixture \"they may prefer\".[48] A modification was also made to the drill for loading so that the cartridge was torn with the hands and not bitten. This, however, merely caused many sepoys to be convinced that the rumours were true and that their fears were justified. Additional rumours started that the paper in the new cartridges, which was glazed and stiffer than the previously used paper, was impregnated with grease.[49] In February, a court of inquiry was held at Barrackpore to get to the bottom of these rumours. Native soldiers called as witnesses complained of the paper \"being stiff and like cloth in the mode of tearing\", said that when the paper was burned it smelled of grease, and announced that the suspicion that the paper itself contained grease could not be removed from their minds.[50]\\n\\nCivilian disquiet\\n\\ntaluqdars\\n\\nDoctrine of Lapse, which refused to recognise the adopted children of princes as legal heirs, felt that the company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as\\n\\nNana Sahib and the\\n\\nRani of Jhansi belonged to this group; the latter, for example, was prepared to accept East India Company supremacy if her adopted son was recognised as her late husband\\'s heir.\\n\\n[51]\\n\\nIndore and\\n\\nSaugar, where such loss of privilege had not occurred, the princes remained loyal to the company, even in areas where the sepoys had rebelled.\\n\\n[52]\\n\\nOudh.  It is mentioned that throughout Oudh, Bihar\\n\\nRajput Taluqdars provided the bulk of leadership and played an important role during 1857 in the region.\\n\\n[53]\\n\\n[54]\\n\\n[55]\\n\\nMuzaffarnagar district, a beneficiary of a Company irrigation scheme, and next door to\\n\\nMeerut, where the upheaval began, stayed relatively calm throughout.\\n\\n[56]\\n\\nCharles Canning, the Governor-General of India during the rebellion.\\n\\nLord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856, who devised the Doctrine of Lapse.\\n\\nLakshmibai, the Rani of Maratha-ruled Jhansi, one of the principal leaders of the rebellion who earlier had lost her kingdom as a result of the Doctrine of Lapse.\\n\\nBahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal Emperor, crowned Emperor of India, by the Indian troops, he was deposed by the British, and died in exile in Burma\\n\\n\"Utilitarian and evangelical-inspired social reform\",[57] including the abolition of sati[58][59] and the legalisation of widow remarriage were considered by many—especially the British themselves[60]—to have caused suspicion that Indian religious traditions were being \"interfered with\", with the ultimate aim of conversion.[60][61] Recent historians, including Chris Bayly, have preferred to frame this as a \"clash of knowledges\", with proclamations from religious authorities before the revolt and testimony after it including on such issues as the \"insults to women\", the rise of \"low persons under British tutelage\", the \"pollution\" caused by Western medicine and the persecuting and ignoring of traditional astrological authorities.[62] British-run schools were also a problem: according to recorded testimonies, anger had spread because of stories that mathematics was replacing religious instruction, stories were chosen that would \"bring contempt\" upon Indian religions, and because girl children were exposed to \"moral danger\" by education.[62]\\n\\nThe justice system was considered to be inherently unfair to the Indians. The official Blue Books, East India (Torture) 1855–1857, laid before the House of Commons during the sessions of 1856 and 1857, revealed that Company officers were allowed an extended series of appeals if convicted or accused of brutality or crimes against Indians.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe economic policies of the East India Company were also resented by many Indians.[63]\\n\\nThe Bengal Army\\n\\nEach of the three \"Presidencies\" into which the East India Company divided India for administrative purposes maintained their own armies. Of these, the Army of the Bengal Presidency was the largest. Unlike the other two, it recruited heavily from among high-caste Hindus and comparatively wealthy Muslims. The Muslims formed a larger percentage of the 18 irregular cavalry units[64] within the Bengal Army, whilst Hindus were mainly to be found in the 84 regular infantry and cavalry regiments. Thus 75% of the cavalry regiments was composed of Indian Muslims, while 80% of the infantry was composed of Hindus.[65] The sepoys were therefore affected to a large degree by the concerns of the landholding and traditional members of Indian society. In the early years of Company rule, it tolerated and even encouraged the caste privileges and customs within the Bengal Army, which recruited its regular infantry soldiers almost exclusively amongst the landowning Rajputs and Brahmins of the Bihar and Awadh regions. These soldiers were known as Purbiyas. By the time these customs and privileges came to be threatened by modernising regimes in Calcutta from the 1840s onwards, the sepoys had become accustomed to very high ritual status and were extremely sensitive to suggestions that their caste might be polluted.[66][29]\\n\\nThe sepoys also gradually became dissatisfied with various other aspects of army life. Their pay was relatively low and after Awadh and the Punjab were annexed, the soldiers no longer received extra pay (batta or bhatta) for service there, because they were no longer considered \"foreign missions\". The junior British officers became increasingly estranged from their soldiers, in many cases treating them as their racial inferiors. In 1856, a new Enlistment Act was introduced by the company, which in theory made every unit in the Bengal Army liable to service overseas. Although it was intended to apply only to new recruits, the serving sepoys feared that the Act might be applied retroactively to them as well.[67] A high-caste Hindu who travelled in the cramped conditions of a wooden troop ship could not cook his own food on his own fire, and accordingly risked losing caste through ritual pollution.[36]:\\u200a243\\n\\nOnset of the rebellion\\n\\nSeveral months of increasing tensions coupled with various incidents preceded the actual rebellion. On 26 February 1857 the 19th Bengal Native Infantry (BNI) regiment became concerned that new cartridges they had been issued were wrapped in paper greased with cow and pig fat, which had to be opened by mouth thus affecting their religious sensibilities. Their Colonel confronted them supported by artillery and cavalry on the parade ground, but after some negotiation withdrew the artillery, and cancelled the next morning\\'s parade.[68]\\n\\nMangal Pandey\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nMangal Pandey\\n\\nOn 29 March 1857 at the Barrackpore parade ground, near Calcutta, 29-year-old Mangal Pandey of the 34th BNI, angered by the recent actions of the East India Company, declared that he would rebel against his commanders. Informed about Pandey\\'s behaviour Sergeant-Major James Hewson went to investigate, only to have Pandey shoot at him. Hewson raised the alarm.[69] When his adjutant Lt. Henry Baugh came out to investigate the unrest, Pandey opened fire but hit Baugh\\'s horse instead.[70]\\n\\nGeneral John Hearsey came out to the parade ground to investigate, and claimed later that Mangal Pandey was in some kind of \"religious frenzy\". He ordered the Indian commander of the quarter guard Jemadar Ishwari Prasad to arrest Mangal Pandey, but the Jemadar refused. The quarter guard and other sepoys present, with the single exception of a soldier called Shaikh Paltu, drew back from restraining or arresting Mangal Pandey. Shaikh Paltu restrained Pandey from continuing his attack.[70][71]\\n\\nAfter failing to incite his comrades into an open and active rebellion, Mangal Pandey tried to take his own life, by placing his musket to his chest and pulling the trigger with his toe. He managed only to wound himself. He was court-martialled on 6 April and hanged two days later.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe Jemadar Ishwari Prasad was sentenced to death and hanged on 21 April. The regiment was disbanded and stripped of its uniforms because it was felt that it harboured ill-feelings towards its superiors, particularly after this incident. Shaikh Paltu was promoted to the rank of havildar in the Bengal Army but was murdered shortly before the 34th BNI dispersed.[72]\\n\\nSepoys in other regiments thought these punishments were harsh. The demonstration of disgrace during the formal disbanding helped foment the rebellion in view of some historians. Disgruntled ex-sepoys returned home to Awadh with a desire for revenge.[citation needed]\\n\\nUnrest during April 1857\\n\\nDuring April, there was unrest and fires at Agra, Allahabad and Ambala. At Ambala in particular, which was a large military cantonment where several units had been collected for their annual musketry practice, it was clear to General Anson, Commander-in-Chief of the Bengal Army, that some sort of rebellion over the cartridges was imminent. Despite the objections of the civilian Governor-General\\'s staff, he agreed to postpone the musketry practice and allow a new drill by which the soldiers tore the cartridges with their fingers rather than their teeth. However, he issued no general orders making this standard practice throughout the Bengal Army and, rather than remain at Ambala to defuse or overawe potential trouble, he then proceeded to Simla, the cool hill station where many high officials spent the summer.[citation needed]\\n\\nAlthough there was no open revolt at Ambala, there was widespread arson during late April. Barrack buildings (especially those belonging to soldiers who had used the Enfield cartridges) and British officers\\' bungalows were set on fire.[73]\\n\\nMeerut\\n\\nIllustrated London News\\n\\nRobert Christopher Tytler and\\n\\nHarriet Tytler of a mosque in Meerut where some of the rebel soldiers may have prayed\\n\\nAt Meerut, a large military cantonment, 2,357 Indian sepoys and 2,038 British soldiers were stationed along with 12 British-manned guns. The station held one of the largest concentrations of British troops in India and this was later to be cited as evidence that the original rising was a spontaneous outbreak rather than a pre-planned plot.[36]:\\u200a278\\n\\nAlthough the state of unrest within the Bengal Army was well known, on 24 April Lieutenant Colonel George Carmichael-Smyth, the unsympathetic commanding officer of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry, which was composed mainly of Indian Muslims,[74] ordered 90 of his men to parade and perform firing drills. All except five of the men on parade refused to accept their cartridges. On 9 May, the remaining 85 men were court martialled, and most were sentenced to 10 years\\' imprisonment with hard labour. Eleven comparatively young soldiers were given five years\\' imprisonment. The entire garrison was paraded and watched as the condemned men were stripped of their uniforms and placed in shackles. As they were marched off to jail, the condemned soldiers berated their comrades for failing to support them.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe next day was Sunday. Some Indian soldiers warned off-duty junior British officers that plans were afoot to release the imprisoned soldiers by force, but the senior officers to whom this was reported took no action. There was also unrest in the city of Meerut itself, with angry protests in the bazaar and some buildings being set on fire. In the evening, most British officers were preparing to attend church, while many of the British soldiers were off duty and had gone into canteens or into the bazaar in Meerut. The Indian troops, led by the 3rd Cavalry, broke into revolt. British junior officers who attempted to quell the first outbreaks were killed by the rebels. British officers\\' and civilians\\' quarters were attacked, and four civilian men, eight women and eight children were killed. Crowds in the bazaar attacked off-duty soldiers there. About 50 Indian civilians, some of them officers\\' servants who tried to defend or conceal their employers, were killed by the sepoys.[75] While the action of the sepoys in freeing their 85 imprisoned comrades appears to have been spontaneous, some civilian rioting in the city was reportedly encouraged by kotwal (local police commander) Dhan Singh Gurjar.[76]\\n\\nSome sepoys (especially from the 11th Bengal Native Infantry) escorted trusted British officers and women and children to safety before joining the revolt.[77] Some officers and their families escaped to Rampur, where they found refuge with the Nawab.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe British historian Philip Mason notes that it was inevitable that most of the sepoys and sowars from Meerut should have made for Delhi on the night of 10 May. It was a strong walled city located only forty miles away, it was the ancient capital and present seat of the nominal Mughal Emperor and finally there were no British troops in garrison there in contrast to Meerut.[36]:\\u200a278\\u200a No effort was made to pursue them.[citation needed]\\n\\nDelhi\\n\\nIllustrated London News\\n\\nSt. James\\' Church, Delhi is seen in the background.\\n\\nEmily Eden\\n\\nEarly on 11 May, the first parties of the 3rd Cavalry reached Delhi. From beneath the windows of the King\\'s apartments in the palace, they called on Bahadur Shah to acknowledge and lead them. He did nothing at this point, apparently treating the sepoys as ordinary petitioners, but others in the palace were quick to join the revolt. During the day, the revolt spread. British officials and dependents, Indian Christians and shop keepers within the city were killed, some by sepoys and others by crowds of rioters.[78]:\\u200a71–73\\n\\nFlagstaff Tower, Delhi, where the British survivors of the rebellion gathered on 11 May 1857; photographed by\\n\\nFelice Beato\\n\\nThere were three battalion-sized regiments of Bengal Native Infantry stationed in or near the city. Some detachments quickly joined the rebellion, while others held back but also refused to obey orders to take action against the rebels. In the afternoon, a violent explosion in the city was heard for several miles. Fearing that the arsenal, which contained large stocks of arms and ammunition, would fall intact into rebel hands, the nine British Ordnance officers there had opened fire on the sepoys, including the men of their own guard. When resistance appeared hopeless, they blew up the arsenal. Six of the nine officers survived, but the blast killed many in the streets and nearby houses and other buildings.[79] The news of these events finally tipped the sepoys stationed around Delhi into open rebellion. The sepoys were later able to salvage at least some arms from the arsenal, and a magazine two miles (3\\xa0km (1.9\\xa0mi)) outside Delhi, containing up to 3,000 barrels of gunpowder, was captured without resistance.[citation needed]\\n\\nMany fugitive British officers and civilians had congregated at the Flagstaff Tower on the ridge north of Delhi, where telegraph operators were sending news of the events to other British stations. When it became clear that the help expected from Meerut was not coming, they made their way in carriages to Karnal. Those who became separated from the main body or who could not reach the Flagstaff Tower also set out for Karnal on foot. Some were helped by villagers on the way; others were killed.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe next day, Bahadur Shah held his first formal court for many years. It was attended by many excited sepoys. The King was alarmed by the turn events had taken, but eventually accepted the sepoys\\' allegiance and agreed to give his countenance to the rebellion. On 16 May, up to 50 British who had been held prisoner in the palace or had been discovered hiding in the city were killed by some of the King\\'s servants under a peepul tree in a courtyard outside the palace.[80][81]\\n\\nSupporters and opposition\\n\\nThe news of the events at Meerut and Delhi spread rapidly, provoking uprisings among sepoys and disturbances in many districts. In many cases, it was the behaviour of British military and civilian authorities themselves which precipitated disorder. Learning of the fall of Delhi, many Company administrators hastened to remove themselves, their families and servants to places of safety. At Agra, 160 miles (260\\xa0km) from Delhi, no fewer than 6,000 assorted non-combatants converged on the Fort.[82]\\n\\nThe military authorities also reacted in disjointed manner. Some officers trusted their sepoys, but others tried to disarm them to forestall potential uprisings. At Benares and Allahabad, the disarmings were bungled, also leading to local revolts.[83]:\\u200a52–53\\n\\nIn 1857, the Bengal Army had 86,000 men, of which 12,000 were British, 16,000 Sikh and 1,500 Gurkha. There were 311,000 native soldiers in India altogether, 40,160 British soldiers (including units of the British Army) and 5,362 officers.[84] Fifty-four of the Bengal Army\\'s 74 regular Native Infantry Regiments mutinied, but some were immediately destroyed or broke up, with their sepoys drifting away to their homes. A number of the remaining 20 regiments were disarmed or disbanded to prevent or forestall mutiny. Only twelve of the original Bengal Native Infantry regiments survived to pass into the new Indian Army.[85] All ten of the Bengal Light Cavalry regiments mutinied.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe Bengal Army also contained 29 irregular cavalry and 42 irregular infantry regiments. Of these, a substantial contingent from the recently annexed state of Awadh mutinied en masse. Another large contingent from Gwalior also mutinied, even though that state\\'s ruler (Jayajirao Scindia) supported the British. The remainder of the irregular units were raised from a wide variety of sources and were less affected by the concerns of mainstream Indian society. Some irregular units actively supported the company: three Gurkha and five of six Sikh infantry units, and the six infantry and six cavalry units of the recently raised Punjab Irregular Force.[86][87]\\n\\nOn 1 April 1858, the number of Indian soldiers in the Bengal army loyal to the company was 80,053.[88][89] However large numbers were hastily raised in the Punjab and North-West Frontier after the outbreak of the Rebellion.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe Bombay army had three mutinies in its 29 regiments, whilst the Madras army had none at all, although elements of one of its 52 regiments refused to volunteer for service in Bengal.[90] Nonetheless, most of southern India remained passive, with only intermittent outbreaks of violence. Many parts of the region were ruled by the Nizams or the Mysore royalty, and were thus not directly under British rule.[citation needed]\\n\\nAlthough most of the mutinous sepoys in Delhi were Hindus, a significant proportion of the insurgents were Muslims. The proportion of ghazis grew to be about a quarter of the local fighting force by the end of the siege and included a regiment of suicide ghazis from Gwalior who had vowed never to eat again and to fight until they met certain death at the hands of British troops.[91] However, most Muslims did not share the rebels\\' dislike of the British administration[92] and their ulema could not agree on whether to declare a jihad.[93] Some Islamic scholars such as Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi and Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi took up arms against the colonial rule,[94] but many Muslims, among them ulema from both the Sunni and Shia sects, sided with the British.[95] Various Ahl-i-Hadith scholars and colleagues of Nanautavi rejected the jihad.[96] The most influential member of Ahl-i-Hadith ulema in Delhi, Maulana Sayyid Nazir Husain Dehlvi, resisted pressure from the mutineers to call for a jihad and instead declared in favour of British rule, viewing the Muslim-British relationship as a legal contract which could not be broken unless their religious rights were breached.[97]\\n\\nThe Sikhs and Pathans of the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province supported the British and helped in the recapture of Delhi.[98] The Sikhs in particular feared reinstatement of Mughal rule in northern India[99] because they had been persecuted by the Mughal dynasty. They also felt disdain towards the Purbiyas or \\'Easterners\\' (Biharis and those from the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh) in the Bengal Army. The Sikhs felt that the bloodiest battles of the First and Second Anglo-Sikh wars (Chillianwala and Ferozeshah), had been won by British troops, while the Hindustani sepoys had refused to meet the Sikhs in battle.[100] These feelings were compounded when Hindustani sepoys were assigned a very visible role as garrison troops in Punjab and awarded profit-making civil posts in the Punjab.[99]\\n\\nThe varied groups in the support and opposing of the uprising is seen as a major cause of its failure.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe revolt\\n\\nInitial stages\\n\\nwood-engraving of Nynee Tal (today\\n\\nNainital) and accompanying story in the\\n\\nIllustrated London News\\n\\nBahadur Shah Zafar was proclaimed the Emperor of the whole of India. Most contemporary and modern accounts suggest that he was coerced by the sepoys and his courtiers to sign the proclamation against his will.[101] In spite of the significant loss of power that the Mughal dynasty had suffered in the preceding centuries, their name still carried great prestige across northern India.[91] Civilians, nobility and other dignitaries took an oath of allegiance. The emperor issued coins in his name, one of the oldest ways of asserting imperial status. The adhesion of the Mughal emperor, however, turned the Sikhs of the Punjab away from the rebellion, as they did not want to return to Islamic rule, having fought many wars against the Mughal rulers. The province of Bengal was largely quiet throughout the entire period. The British, who had long ceased to take the authority of the Mughal Emperor seriously, were astonished at how the ordinary people responded to Zafar\\'s call for war.[91]\\n\\nInitially, the Indian rebels were able to push back Company forces, and captured several important towns in Haryana, Bihar, the Central Provinces and the United Provinces. When British troops were reinforced and began to counterattack, the mutineers were especially handicapped by their lack of centralized command and control. Although the rebels produced some natural leaders such as Bakht Khan, whom the Emperor later nominated as commander-in-chief after his son Mirza Mughal proved ineffectual, for the most part they were forced to look for leadership to rajahs and princes. Some of these were to prove dedicated leaders, but others were self-interested or inept.[citation needed]\\n\\nIn the countryside around Meerut, a general Gurjar uprising posed the largest threat to the British. In Parikshitgarh near Meerut, Gurjars declared Choudhari Kadam Singh (Kuddum Singh) their leader, and expelled Company police. Kadam Singh Gurjar led a large force, estimates varying from 2,000 to 10,000.[102] Bulandshahr and Bijnor also came under the control of Gurjars under Walidad Khan and Maho Singh respectively. Contemporary sources report that nearly all the Gurjar villages between Meerut and Delhi participated in the revolt, in some cases with support from Jullundur, and it was not until late July that, with the help of local Jats, and the princely states, the British managed to regain control of the area.[102]\\n\\nThe Imperial Gazetteer of India states that throughout the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Gurjars and Ranghars proved the \"most irreconcilable enemies\" of the British in the Bulandshahr area.[103]\\n\\nMufti Nizamuddin, a renowned scholar of Lahore, issued a Fatwa against the British forces and called upon the local population to support the forces of Rao Tula Ram. Casualties were high at the subsequent engagement at Narnaul (Nasibpur). After the defeat of Rao Tula Ram on 16 November 1857, Mufti Nizamuddin was arrested, and his brother Mufti Yaqinuddin and brother-in-law Abdur Rahman (alias Nabi Baksh) were arrested in Tijara. They were taken to Delhi and hanged.[104]\\n\\nSiege of Delhi\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nSiege of Delhi\\n\\nThe British were slow to strike back at first. It took time for troops stationed in Britain to make their way to India by sea, although some regiments moved overland through Persia from the Crimean War, and some regiments already en route for China were diverted to India.[citation needed]\\n\\nIt took time to organise the British troops already in India into field forces, but eventually two columns left Meerut and Simla. They proceeded slowly towards Delhi and fought, killed, and hanged numerous Indians along the way. Two months after the first outbreak of rebellion at Meerut, the two forces met near Karnal. The combined force, including two Gurkha units serving in the Bengal Army under contract from the Kingdom of Nepal, fought the rebels\\' main army at Badli-ke-Serai and drove them back to Delhi.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe company\\'s army established a base on the Delhi ridge to the north of the city and the Siege of Delhi began. The siege lasted roughly from 1 July to 21 September. However, the encirclement was hardly complete, and for much of the siege the besiegers were outnumbered and it often seemed that it was the Company forces and not Delhi that were under siege, as the rebels could easily receive resources and reinforcements. For several weeks, it seemed likely that disease, exhaustion and continuous sorties by rebels from Delhi would force the besiegers to withdraw, but the outbreaks of rebellion in the Punjab were forestalled or suppressed, allowing the Punjab Movable Column of British, Sikh and Pakhtun soldiers under John Nicholson to reinforce the besiegers on the Ridge on 14 August.[105] On 30 August the rebels offered terms, which were refused.[106]\\n\\nThe Jantar Mantar observatory in Delhi in 1858, damaged in the fighting\\n\\nMortar damage to Kashmiri Gate, Delhi, 1858\\n\\nHindu Rao\\'s house in Delhi, now a hospital, was extensively damaged in the fighting.\\n\\nThe Bank of Delhi was attacked by mortar and gunfire.\\n\\nAn eagerly awaited heavy siege train joined the besieging force, and from 7 September, the siege guns battered breaches in the walls and silenced the rebels\\' artillery.[107]:\\u200a478\\u200a An attempt to storm the city through the breaches and the Kashmiri Gate was launched on 14 September.[107]:\\u200a480\\u200a The attackers gained a foothold within the city but suffered heavy casualties, including John Nicholson. Major General Archdale Wilson, the British commander, wished to withdraw, but was persuaded to hold on by his junior officers. After a week of street fighting, the British reached the Red Fort. Bahadur Shah Zafar had already fled to Humayun\\'s tomb. The British had retaken the city.[citation needed]\\n\\nBahadur Shah Zafar and his sons by\\n\\nWilliam Hodson at\\n\\nHumayun\\'s tomb on 20 September 1857\\n\\nThe troops of the besieging force proceeded to loot and pillage the city. A large number of citizens were killed in retaliation for the British and Indian civilians that had been slaughtered by the rebels. During the street fighting, artillery was set up in the city\\'s main mosque. Neighbourhoods within range were bombarded; the homes of the Muslim nobility that housed innumerable cultural, artistic, literary and monetary riches were destroyed.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe British soon arrested Bahadur Shah Zafar, and the next day the British agent William Hodson had his sons Mirza Mughal and Mirza Khizr Sultan and grandson Mirza Abu Bakr shot under his own authority at the Khooni Darwaza (the bloody gate) near Delhi Gate. On hearing the news, Zafar reacted with shocked silence, while his wife Zinat Mahal was content, as she believed her son was now Zafar\\'s heir.[108] Shortly after the fall of Delhi, the victorious attackers organised a column that relieved another besieged Company force in Agra, and then pressed on to Cawnpore, which had also recently been retaken. This gave the Company forces a continuous, although still tenuous, line of communication from the east to the west of India.[citation needed]\\n\\nCawnpore (Kanpur)\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nSiege of Cawnpore\\n\\nAll Souls Memorial Church, Cawnpore. Albumen silver print by\\n\\nSamuel Bourne, 1860\\n\\nIn June, sepoys under General Wheeler in Cawnpore (now Kanpur) rebelled and besieged the British entrenchment. Wheeler was not only a veteran and respected soldier but also married to an Indian woman. He had relied on his own prestige and his cordial relations with local landholder and hereditary prince Nana Sahib to thwart rebellion, and took comparatively few measures to prepare fortifications and lay in supplies and ammunition.[citation needed]\\n\\nAzimullah Khan, Nana Sahib led the rebels at Kanpur rather than join the\\n\\nMughals in\\n\\nDelhi.\\n\\n[109]\\n\\nSiege of Cawnpore with little water or food, suffering continuous casualties among men, women and children. On 25 June Nana Sahib made an offer of safe passage to Allahabad. With barely three days\\' food rations remaining, the British agreed, provided they could keep their small arms and that the evacuation should take place in daylight on the morning of the 27th (the Nana Sahib wanted the evacuation to take place on the night of the 26th). Early in the morning of 27 June, the British party left their entrenchment and made their way to the river where boats provided by the Nana Sahib were waiting to take them to\\n\\nAllahabad.\\n\\n[110]\\n\\n[111]\\n\\n[112]\\n\\n[113]\\n\\n[113]\\n\\n[113]\\n\\nBibighar massacre.\\n\\n[114]\\n\\nMowbray Thomson, who wrote a first-hand account of his experiences entitled\\n\\ncitation needed\\n\\nDuring his trial, Tatya Tope denied the existence of any such plan and described the incident in the following terms: the British had already boarded the boats and Tatya Tope raised his right hand to signal their departure. That very moment someone from the crowd blew a loud bugle, which created disorder and in the ongoing bewilderment, the boatmen jumped off the boats. The rebels started shooting indiscriminately. Nana Sahib, who was staying in Savada Kothi (Bungalow) nearby, was informed about what was happening and immediately came to stop it.[115] Some British histories allow that it might well have been the result of accident or error; someone accidentally or maliciously fired a shot, the panic-stricken British opened fire, and it became impossible to stop the massacre.[83]:\\u200a56\\n\\nThe surviving women and children were taken to Nana Sahib and then confined first to the Savada Kothi and then to the home of the local magistrate\\'s clerk (the Bibighar)[116] where they were joined by refugees from Fatehgarh. Overall, five men and 206 women and children were confined in the Bibigarh for about two weeks. In one week 25 were brought out, dead from dysentery and cholera.[112] Meanwhile, a Company relief force that had advanced from Allahabad defeated the Indians and by 15 July it was clear that Nana Sahib would not be able to hold Cawnpore and a decision was made by Nana Sahib and other leading rebels that the hostages must be killed. After the sepoys refused to carry out this order, two Muslim butchers, two Hindu peasants and one of Nana\\'s bodyguards went into the Bibigarh. Armed with knives and hatchets, they murdered the women and children.[117] After the massacre, the walls were covered in bloody handprints, and the floor littered with parts of human limbs.[118] The dead and the dying were thrown down a nearby well. When the 50-foot (15\\xa0m) deep well was filled with remains to within 6 feet (1.8\\xa0m) of the top,[119] the remainder were thrown into the Ganges.[120]\\n\\nHistorians have given many reasons for this act of cruelty. With Company forces approaching Cawnpore, some believed that they would not advance if there were no hostages to save. Or perhaps it was to ensure that no information was leaked after the fall of Cawnpore. Other historians have suggested that the killings were an attempt to undermine Nana Sahib\\'s relationship with the British.[117] Perhaps it was due to fear, the fear of being recognised by some of the prisoners for having taken part in the earlier firings.[114]\\n\\nPhotograph entitled, \"The Hospital in General Wheeler\\'s entrenchment, Cawnpore\".

The British public was aghast, and the anti-Imperial and pro-Indian proponents lost all of their support. Cawnpore became a war cry for the British and their allies for the rest of the conflict. Nana Sahib disappeared near the end of the rebellion, and it is not known what happened to him.[citation needed]\\n\\nOther British accounts[121][122][123] state that indiscriminate punitive measures were taken in early June, two weeks before the murders at the Bibighar (but after those at both Meerut and Delhi), specifically by Lieutenant Colonel James George Smith Neill of the Madras Fusiliers, commanding at Allahabad, while moving towards Cawnpore. At the nearby town of Fatehpur, a mob had attacked and murdered the local British population. On this pretext, Neill ordered all villages beside the Grand Trunk Road to be burned and their inhabitants to be hanged. Neill\\'s methods were \"ruthless and horrible\",[83]:\\u200a53\\u200a and far from intimidating the population, may well have induced previously undecided sepoys and communities to revolt.[citation needed]\\n\\nNeill was killed in action at Lucknow on 26 September and was never called to account for his punitive measures, though contemporary British sources lionised him and his \"gallant blue caps\".[s] When the British retook Cawnpore, the soldiers took their sepoy prisoners to the Bibighar and forced them to lick the bloodstains from the walls and floor.[124] They then hanged or \"blew from the cannon\", the traditional Mughal punishment for mutiny, the majority of the sepoy prisoners. Although some claimed the sepoys took no actual part in the killings themselves, they did not act to stop it and this was acknowledged by Captain Thompson after the British departed Cawnpore for a second time.[citation needed]\\n\\nLucknow\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nSiege of Lucknow\\n\\nVery soon after the events at Meerut, rebellion erupted in the state of Awadh (also known as Oudh, in modern-day Uttar Pradesh), which had been annexed barely a year before. The British Commissioner resident at Lucknow, Sir Henry Lawrence, had enough time to fortify his position inside the Residency compound. The defenders, including loyal sepoys, numbered some 1700 men. The rebels\\' assaults were unsuccessful, so they began a barrage of artillery and musket fire into the compound. Lawrence was one of the first casualties. He was succeeded by John Eardley Inglis. The rebels tried to breach the walls with explosives and bypass them via tunnels that led to underground close combat.[107]:\\u200a486\\u200a After 90 days of siege, the defenders were reduced to 300 loyal sepoys, 350 British soldiers and 550 non-combatants.[citation needed]\\n\\nOn 25 September, a relief column under the command of Sir Henry Havelock and accompanied by Sir James Outram (who in theory was his superior) fought its way from Cawnpore to Lucknow in a brief campaign, in which the numerically small column defeated rebel forces in a series of increasingly large battles. This became known as \\'The First Relief of Lucknow\\', as this force was not strong enough to break the siege or extricate themselves, and so was forced to join the garrison. In October, another larger army under the new Commander-in-Chief, Sir Colin Campbell, was finally able to relieve the garrison and on 18 November, they evacuated the defended enclave within the city, the women and children leaving first. They then conducted an orderly withdrawal, firstly to Alambagh 4 miles (6.4\\xa0km) north where a force of 4,000 were left to construct a fort, then to Cawnpore, where they defeated an attempt by Tantia Tope to recapture the city in the Second Battle of Cawnpore.[citation needed]\\n\\nFelice Beato, 1858\\n\\nIn March 1858, Campbell once again advanced on Lucknow with a large army, meeting up with the force at Alambagh, this time seeking to suppress the rebellion in Awadh. He was aided by a large Nepalese contingent advancing from the north under Jung Bahadur Kunwar Rana.[125] General Dhir Shamsher Kunwar Rana, the youngest brother of Jung Bahadur, also led the Nepalese forces in various parts of India including Lucknow, Benares and Patna.[1][126] Campbell\\'s advance was slow and methodical, with a force under General Outram crossing the river on cask bridges on 4 March to enable them to fire artillery in flank. Campbell drove the large but disorganised rebel army from Lucknow with the final fighting taking place on 21 March.[107]:\\u200a491\\u200a There were few casualties to Campbell\\'s own troops, but his cautious movements allowed large numbers of the rebels to disperse into Awadh. Campbell was forced to spend the summer and autumn dealing with scattered pockets of resistance while losing men to heat, disease and guerrilla actions.[citation needed]\\n\\nJhansi\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nCentral India Campaign (1858)\\n\\nJhansi Fort, which was taken over by rebel forces, and subsequently defended against British recapture by the\\n\\nRani of Jhansi\\n\\nJhansi State was a Maratha-ruled princely state in Bundelkhand. When the Raja of Jhansi died without a biological male heir in 1853, it was annexed to the British Raj by the Governor-General of India under the doctrine of lapse. His widow Rani Lakshmi Bai, the Rani of Jhansi, protested against the denial of rights of their adopted son. When war broke out, Jhansi quickly became a centre of the rebellion. A small group of Company officials and their families took refuge in Jhansi Fort, and the Rani negotiated their evacuation. However, when they left the fort they were massacred by the rebels over whom the Rani had no control; the British suspected the Rani of complicity, despite her repeated denials.[citation needed]\\n\\nBy the end of June 1857, the company had lost control of much of Bundelkhand and eastern Rajasthan. The Bengal Army units in the area, having rebelled, marched to take part in the battles for Delhi and Cawnpore. The many princely states that made up this area began warring amongst themselves. In September and October 1857, the Rani led the successful defence of Jhansi against the invading armies of the neighbouring rajas of Datia and Orchha.[citation needed]\\n\\nOn 3 February, Sir Hugh Rose broke the 3-month siege of Saugor. Thousands of local villagers welcomed him as a liberator, freeing them from rebel occupation.[127]\\n\\nIn March 1858, the Central India Field Force, led by Sir Hugh Rose, advanced on and laid siege to Jhansi. The Company forces captured the city, but the Rani fled in disguise.[citation needed]\\n\\nAfter being driven from Jhansi and Kalpi, on 1 June 1858 Rani Lakshmi Bai and a group of Maratha rebels captured the fortress city of Gwalior from the Scindia rulers, who were British allies. This might have reinvigorated the rebellion, but the Central India Field Force very quickly advanced against the city. The Rani died on 17 June, the second day of the Battle of Gwalior, probably killed by a carbine shot from the 8th King\\'s Royal Irish Hussars according to the account of three independent Indian representatives. The Company forces recaptured Gwalior within the next three days. In descriptions of the scene of her last battle, she was compared to Joan of Arc by some commentators.[128]\\n\\nIndore\\n\\nColonel Henry Marion Durand, the then-Company resident at Indore, had brushed away any possibility of uprising in Indore.[129] However, on 1 July, sepoys in Holkar\\'s army revolted and opened fire on the cavalry pickets of the Bhopal Contingent (a locally raised force with British officers). When Colonel Travers rode forward to charge, the Bhopal Cavalry refused to follow. The Bhopal Infantry also refused orders and instead levelled their guns at British sergeants and officers. Since all possibility of mounting an effective deterrent was lost, Durand decided to gather up all the British residents and escape, although 39 British residents of Indore were killed.[130]\\n\\nBihar\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nSiege of Arrah\\n\\nThe rebellion in Bihar was mainly concentrated in the Western regions of the state; however, there were also some outbreaks of plundering and looting in Gaya district.[131]\\nOne of the central figures was Kunwar Singh, the 80-year-old Rajput Zamindar of Jagdispur, whose estate was in the process of being sequestrated by the Revenue Board, instigated and assumed the leadership of revolt in Bihar.[132] His efforts were supported by his brother Babu Amar Singh and his commander-in-chief Hare Krishna Singh.[133]\\n\\nOn 25 July, mutiny erupted in the garrisons of Danapur. Mutinying sepoys from the 7th, 8th and 40th regiments of Bengal Native Infantry quickly moved towards the city of Arrah and were joined by Kunwar Singh and his men.[134] Mr. Boyle, a British railway engineer in Arrah, had already prepared an outbuilding on his property for defence against such attacks.[135] As the rebels approached Arrah, all British residents took refuge at Mr. Boyle\\'s house.[136] A siege soon ensued – eighteen civilians and 50 loyal sepoys from the Bengal Military Police Battalion under the command of Herwald Wake, the local magistrate, defended the house against artillery and musketry fire from an estimated 2000 to 3000 mutineers and rebels.[137]\\n\\nOn 29 July 400 men were sent out from Danapur to relieve Arrah, but this force was ambushed by the rebels around a mile away from the siege house, severely defeated, and driven back. On 30 July, Major Vincent Eyre, who was going up the river with his troops and guns, reached Buxar and heard about the siege. He immediately disembarked his guns and troops (the 5th Fusiliers) and started marching towards Arrah, disregarding direct orders not to do so.[138] On 2 August, some 6 miles (9.7\\xa0km) short of Arrah, the Major was ambushed by the mutineers and rebels. After an intense fight, the 5th Fusiliers charged and stormed the rebel positions successfully.[137] On 3 August, Major Eyre and his men reached the siege house and successfully ended the siege.[139][140]\\n\\nAfter receiving reinforcements, Major Eyre pursued Kunwar Singh to his palace in Jagdispur; however, Singh had left by the time Eyre\\'s forces arrived. Eyre then proceeded to destroy the palace and the homes of Singh\\'s brothers.[137]\\n\\nIn addition to Kunwar Singh\\'s efforts, there were also rebellions carried out by Hussain Baksh Khan, Ghulam Ali Khan and Fateh Singh among others in Gaya, Nawada and Jehanabad districts.[141]\\n\\nIn Lohardaga district of South Bihar (now in Jharkhand), a major rebellion was led by Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo who was part of the Nagavanshi dynasty.[142] He was motivated by disputes he had with the Christian Kol tribals who had been grabbing his land and were implicitly supported by the British authorities. The rebels in South Bihar asked him to lead them and he readily accepted this offer. He organised a Mukti Vahini (people\\'s army) with the assistance of nearby zamindars including Pandey Ganpat Rai and Nadir Ali Khan.[142]\\n\\nOther regions\\n\\nPunjab and Afghan Frontier\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nSecond Anglo-Afghan Treaty (1857)\\n\\nWhat was then referred to by the British as the Punjab was a very large administrative division, centred on Lahore. It included not only the present-day Indian and Pakistani Punjabi regions but also the North West Frontier districts bordering Afghanistan.[citation needed]\\n\\nMuch of the region had been the Sikh Empire, ruled by Ranjit Singh until his death in 1839. The kingdom had then fallen into disorder, with court factions and the Khalsa (the Sikh army) contending for power at the Lahore Durbar (court). After two Anglo-Sikh Wars, the entire region was annexed by the East India Company in 1849. In 1857, the region still contained the highest numbers of both British and Indian troops.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe inhabitants of the Punjab were not as sympathetic to the sepoys as they were elsewhere in India, which limited many of the outbreaks in the Punjab to disjointed uprisings by regiments of sepoys isolated from each other. In some garrisons, notably Ferozepore, indecision on the part of the senior British officers allowed the sepoys to rebel, but the sepoys then left the area, mostly heading for Delhi.[citation needed] At the most important garrison, that of Peshawar close to the Afghan frontier, many comparatively junior officers ignored their nominal commander, General Reed, and took decisive action. They intercepted the sepoys\\' mail, thus preventing their coordinating an uprising, and formed a force known as the \"Punjab Movable Column\" to move rapidly to suppress any revolts as they occurred. When it became clear from the intercepted correspondence that some of the sepoys at Peshawar were on the point of open revolt, the four most disaffected Bengal Native regiments were disarmed by the two British infantry regiments in the cantonment, backed by artillery, on 22 May. This decisive act induced many local chieftains to side with the British.[143]:\\u200a276\\n\\nLectern in memory of 35 British soldiers in Jhelum\\n\\nJhelum in Punjab saw a mutiny of native troops against the British. Here 35 British soldiers of Her Majesty\\'s 24th Regiment of Foot (South Wales Borderers) were killed by mutineers on 7 July 1857. Among the dead was Captain Francis Spring, the eldest son of Colonel William Spring. To commemorate this event St. John\\'s Church Jhelum was built and the names of those 35 British soldiers are carved on a marble lectern present in that church.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe final large-scale military uprising in the Punjab took place on 9 July, when most of a brigade of sepoys at Sialkot rebelled and began to move to Delhi.[144] They were intercepted by John Nicholson with an equal British force as they tried to cross the Ravi River. After fighting steadily but unsuccessfully for several hours, the sepoys tried to fall back across the river but became trapped on an island. Three days later, Nicholson annihilated the 1,100 trapped sepoys in the Battle of Trimmu Ghat.[143]:\\u200a290–293\\n\\nThe British had been recruiting irregular units from Sikh and Pakhtun communities even before the first unrest among the Bengal units, and the numbers of these were greatly increased during the Rebellion, 34,000 fresh levies eventually being pressed into service.[145]\\n\\nWilliam Alexander Kerr,\\n\\n24th Bombay Native Infantry, near\\n\\nKolapore, July 1857\\n\\nAt one stage, faced with the need to send troops to reinforce the besiegers of Delhi, the Commissioner of the Punjab (Sir John Lawrence) suggested handing the coveted prize of Peshawar to Dost Mohammad Khan of Afghanistan in return for a pledge of friendship. The British Agents in Peshawar and the adjacent districts were horrified. Referring to the massacre of a retreating British army in 1842, Herbert Edwardes wrote, \"Dost Mahomed would not be a mortal Afghan ... if he did not assume our day to be gone in India and follow after us as an enemy. British cannot retreat – Kabul would come again.\"[143]:\\u200a283\\u200a In the event Lord Canning insisted on Peshawar being held, and Dost Mohammad, whose relations with Britain had been equivocal for over 20 years, remained neutral.[citation needed]\\n\\nIn September 1858 Rai Ahmad Khan Kharal, head of the Khurrul tribe, led an insurrection in the Neeli Bar district, between the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers. The rebels held the jungles of Gogaira and had some initial successes against the British forces in the area, besieging Major Crawford Chamberlain at Chichawatni. A squadron of Punjabi cavalry sent by Sir John Lawrence raised the siege. Ahmed Khan was killed but the insurgents found a new leader in Mahr Bahawal Fatyana, who maintained the uprising for three months until Government forces penetrated the jungle and scattered the rebel tribesmen.[78]:\\u200a343–344\\n\\nBengal and Tripura\\n\\nIn September 1857, sepoys took control of the treasury in Chittagong.[146] The treasury remained under rebel control for several days. Further mutinies on 18 November saw the 2nd, 3rd and 4th companies of the 34th Bengal Infantry Regiment storming the Chittagong Jail and releasing all prisoners. The mutineers were eventually suppressed by the Gurkha regiments.[147] The mutiny also spread to Kolkata and later Dhaka, the former Mughal capital of Bengal. Residents in the city\\'s Lalbagh area were kept awake at night by the rebellion.[148] Sepoys joined hands with the common populace in Jalpaiguri to take control of the city\\'s cantonment.[146] In January 1858, many sepoys received shelter from the royal family of the princely state of Hill Tippera.[146]\\n\\nThe interior areas of Bengal proper were already experiencing growing resistance to Company rule due to the Muslim Faraizi movement.[146]\\n\\nGujarat\\n\\nIn central and north Gujarat, the rebellion was sustained by landowner Jagirdars, Talukdars and Thakors with the support of armed communities of Bhil, Koli, Pathans and Arabs, unlike the mutiny by sepoys in north India. Their main opposition of British was due to Inam commission. The Bet Dwarka island, along with Okhamandal region of Kathiawar peninsula which was under Gaekwad of Baroda State, saw a revolt by the Waghers in January 1858 who, by July 1859, controlled that region. In October 1859, a joint offensive by British, Gaekwad and other princely states troops ousted the rebels and recaptured the region.[149][150][151]\\n\\nOrissa\\n\\nDuring the rebellion, Surendra Sai was one of the many people broken out of Hazaribagh jail by mutineers.[152] In the middle of September Surendra established himself in Sambalpur\\'s old fort. He quickly organised a meeting with the Assistant Commissioner (Captain Leigh), and Leigh agreed to ask the government to cancel his and his brother\\'s imprisonment while Surendra dispersed his followers. This agreement was soon broken, however, when on 31 September escaped the town and make for Khinda, where his brother was located with a 1,400-man force.[152] The British quickly moved to send two companies from the 40th Madras Native Infantry from Cuttack on 10 October, and after a forced march reached Khinda on 5 November, only to find the place abandoned as the rebels retreated to the jungle. Much of the country of Sambalpur was under the rebels\\' control, and they maintained a hit and run guerrilla war for quite some time. In December the British made further preparations to crush the uprising in Sambalpur, and it was temporarily transferred from the Chota Nagpur Division into the Orissa Division of the Bengal Presidency. On the 30th a major battle was fought in which Surendra\\'s brother was killed and the mutineers were routed. In January the British achieved minor successes, capturing a few major villages like Kolabira, and in February calm began to be restored. However, Surendra still held out, and the jungle hampered British parties from capturing him. Additionally, any native daring to collaborate with the British were terrorized along with their family. After a new policy that promised amnesty for mutineers, Surendra surrendered in May 1862.[152]\\n\\nBritish Empire\\n\\nThe authorities in British colonies with an Indian population, sepoy or civilian, took measures to secure themselves against copycat uprisings. In the Straits Settlements and Trinidad the annual Hosay processions were banned,[153] riots broke out in penal settlements in Burma and the Settlements, in Penang the loss of a musket provoked a near riot,[154] and security was boosted especially in locations with an Indian convict population.[155]\\n\\nConsequences\\n\\nDeath toll and atrocities\\n\\nThomas Jones Barker\\n\\nBoth sides committed atrocities against civilians.[t][14]\\n\\nIn Oudh alone, some estimates put the toll at 150,000 Indians killed during the war, with 100,000 of them being civilians. The capture of Delhi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Lucknow by British forces were followed by general massacres.[156]\\n\\nAnother notable atrocity was carried out by General Neill who massacred thousands of Indian mutineers and Indian civilians suspected of supporting the rebellion.[157]\\n\\nThe rebels\\' murder of British women, children and wounded soldiers (including sepoys who sided with the British) at Cawnpore, and the subsequent printing of the events in the British papers, left many British soldiers outraged and seeking revenge. Aside from hanging mutineers, the British had some \"blown from cannon\", (an old Mughal punishment adopted many years before in India), in which sentenced rebels were tied over the mouths of cannons and blown to pieces when the cannons were fired.[158][159] A particular act of cruelty on behalf of the British troops at Cawnpore included forcing many Muslim or Hindu rebels to eat pork or beef, as well as licking buildings freshly stained with blood of the dead before subsequent public hangings.[159]\\n\\nPractices of torture included \"searing with hot irons...dipping in wells and rivers till the victim is half suffocated... squeezing the testicles...putting pepper and red chillies in the eyes or introducing them into the private parts of men and women...prevention of sleep...nipping the flesh with pinners...suspension from the branches of a tree...imprisonment in a room used for storing lime...\"[160]\\n\\nBritish soldiers also committed sexual violence against Indian women as a form of retaliation against the rebellion.[161][162] As towns and cities were captured from the sepoys, the British soldiers took their revenge on Indian civilians by committing atrocities and rapes against Indian women.[163][164][165][166][167]\\n\\nMost of the British press, outraged by the stories of alleged rape committed by the rebels against British women, as well as the killings of British civilians and wounded British soldiers, did not advocate clemency of any kind towards the Indian population.[168] Governor General Canning ordered moderation in dealing with native sensibilities and earned the scornful sobriquet \"Clemency Canning\" from the press[169] and later parts of the British public.\\n\\nIn terms of sheer numbers, the casualties were much higher on the Indian side. A letter published after the fall of Delhi in the Bombay Telegraph and reproduced in the British press testified to the scale of the Indian casualties:\\n\\n.... All the city\\'s people found within the walls of the city of Delhi when our troops entered were bayoneted on the spot, and the number was considerable, as you may suppose, when I tell you that in some houses forty and fifty people were hiding. These were not mutineers but residents of the city, who trusted to our well-known mild rule for pardon. I am glad to say they were disappointed.[170]\\n\\nFrom the end of 1857, the British had begun to gain ground again. Lucknow was retaken in March 1858. On 8 July 1858, a peace treaty was signed, and the rebellion ended. The last rebels were defeated in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. By 1859, rebel leaders Bakht Khan and Nana Sahib had either been slain or had fled.[citation needed]\\n\\nEdward Vibart, a 19-year-old officer whose parents, younger brothers, and two of his sisters had died in the Cawnpore massacre,[171] recorded his experience:\\n\\nThe orders went out to shoot every soul.... It was literally murder... I have seen many bloody and awful sights lately but such a one as I witnessed yesterday I pray I never see again. The women were all spared but their screams on seeing their husbands and sons butchered, were most painful... Heaven knows I feel no pity, but when some old grey bearded man is brought and shot before your very eyes, hard must be that man\\'s heart I think who can look on with indifference ...[172]\\n\\nblowing from a gun by the British, 8 September 1857.\\n\\nSome British troops adopted a policy of \"no prisoners\". One officer, Thomas Lowe, remembered how on one occasion his unit had taken 76 prisoners – they were just too tired to carry on killing and needed a rest, he recalled. Later, after a quick trial, the prisoners were lined up with a British soldier standing a couple of yards in front of them. On the order \"fire\", they were all simultaneously shot, \"swept... from their earthly existence\".[citation needed]\\n\\nThe aftermath of the rebellion has been the focus of new work using Indian sources and population studies. In The Last Mughal, historian William Dalrymple examines the effects on the Muslim population of Delhi after the city was retaken by the British and finds that intellectual and economic control of the city shifted from Muslim to Hindu hands because the British, at that time, saw an Islamic hand behind the mutiny.[173]\\n\\nApproximately 6,000 of the 40,000 British living in India were killed.[2]\\n\\nReaction in Britain\\n\\nSir John Tenniel in a September 1857 issue of\\n\\nPunch\\n\\nThe scale of the punishments handed out by the British \"Army of Retribution\" was considered largely appropriate and justified in a Britain shocked by embellished reports of atrocities carried out against British troops and civilians by the rebels.[174] Accounts of the time frequently reach the \"hyperbolic register\", according to Christopher Herbert, especially in the often-repeated claim that the \"Red Year\" of 1857 marked \"a terrible break\" in British experience.[170] Such was the atmosphere – a national \"mood of retribution and despair\" that led to \"almost universal approval\" of the measures taken to pacify the revolt.[175]:\\u200a87\\n\\nIncidents of rape allegedly committed by Indian rebels against British women and girls appalled the British public. These atrocities were often used to justify the British reaction to the rebellion. British newspapers printed various eyewitness accounts of the rape of English women and girls. One such account was published by The Times, regarding an incident where 48 English girls as young as 10 had been raped by Indian rebels in Delhi. Karl Marx criticized this story as false propaganda, and pointed out that the story was written by a clergyman in Bangalore, far from the events of the rebellion, with no evidence to support his allegation.[176] Individual incidents captured the public\\'s interest and were heavily reported by the press. One such incident was that of General Wheeler\\'s daughter Margaret being forced to live as her captor\\'s concubine, though this was reported to the Victorian public as Margaret killing her rapist then herself.[177] Another version of the story suggested that Margaret had been killed after her abductor had argued with his wife over her.[178]\\n\\nDuring the aftermath of the rebellion, a series of exhaustive investigations were carried out by British police and intelligence officials into reports that British women prisoners had been \"dishonoured\" at the Bibighar and elsewhere. One such detailed enquiry was at the direction of Lord Canning. The consensus was that there was no convincing evidence of such crimes having been committed, although numbers of British women and children had been killed outright.[179]\\n\\nThe term \\'Sepoy\\' or \\'Sepoyism\\' became a derogatory term for nationalists, especially in Ireland.[180]\\n\\nReorganisation\\n\\nThis section needs additional citations for verification .

In 1877 Queen Victoria took the title of Empress of India on the advice of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.[181]\\n\\nThe rebellion saw the end of the East India Company\\'s rule in India. In August, by the Government of India Act 1858, the company\\'s ruling powers over India were transferred to the British Crown.[182] A new British government department, the India Office, was created to handle the governance of India, and its head, the Secretary of State for India, was entrusted with formulating Indian policy. The Governor-General of India gained a new title, Viceroy of India, and implemented the policies devised by the India Office. Some former East India Company territories, such as the Straits Settlements, became colonies in their own right. The British colonial administration embarked on a program of reform, trying to integrate Indian higher castes and rulers into the government and abolishing attempts at Westernization. The Viceroy stopped land grabs, decreed religious tolerance and admitted Indians into civil service, albeit mainly as subordinates.[citation needed]\\n\\nEssentially the old East India Company bureaucracy remained, though there was a major shift in attitudes. In looking for the causes of the Rebellion the authorities alighted on two things: religion and the economy. On religion it was felt that there had been too much interference with indigenous traditions, both Hindu and Muslim. On the economy it was now believed that the previous attempts by the company to introduce free market competition had undermined traditional power structures and bonds of loyalty placing the peasantry at the mercy of merchants and moneylenders. In consequence the new British Raj was constructed in part around a conservative agenda, based on a preservation of tradition and hierarchy.[citation needed]\\n\\nOn a political level it was also felt that the previous lack of consultation between rulers and ruled had been another significant factor in contributing to the uprising. In consequence, Indians were drawn into government at a local level. Though this was on a limited scale a crucial precedent had been set, with the creation of a new \\'white collar\\' Indian elite, further stimulated by the opening of universities at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, a result of the Indian Universities Act. So, alongside the values of traditional and ancient India, a new professional middle class was starting to arise, in no way bound by the values of the past. Their ambition can only have been stimulated by Queen Victoria\\'s Proclamation of November 1858, in which it is expressly stated, \"We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the same obligations of duty which bind us to our other subjects...it is our further will that... our subjects of whatever race or creed, be freely and impartially admitted to offices in our service, the duties of which they may be qualified by their education, ability and integrity, duly to discharge.\"[citation needed]\\n\\nActing on these sentiments, Lord Ripon, viceroy from 1880 to 1885, extended the powers of local self-government and sought to remove racial practices in the law courts by the Ilbert Bill. But a policy at once liberal and progressive at one turn was reactionary and backward at the next, creating new elites and confirming old attitudes. The Ilbert Bill had the effect only of causing a white mutiny and the end of the prospect of perfect equality before the law. In 1886 measures were adopted to restrict Indian entry into the civil service.[citation needed]\\n\\nMilitary reorganisation\\n\\nMadras Regiment, who fell on the attack of Fort of Kohlee, 1858. Memorial at the\\n\\nSt. Mary\\'s Church, Madras\\n\\nYork Minster\\n\\nThe Bengal army dominated the Indian army before 1857 and a direct result after the rebellion was the scaling back of the size of the Bengali contingent in the army.[183] The Brahmin presence in the Bengal Army was reduced because of their perceived primary role as mutineers. The British looked for increased recruitment in the Punjab for the Bengal army as a result of the apparent discontent that resulted in the Sepoy conflict.[184]\\n\\nThe rebellion transformed both the native and British armies of British India. Of the 74 regular Bengal Native Infantry regiments in existence at the beginning of 1857, only twelve escaped mutiny or disbandment.[185] All ten of the Bengal Light Cavalry regiments were lost. The old Bengal Army had accordingly almost completely vanished from the order of battle. These troops were replaced by new units recruited from castes hitherto under-utilised by the British and from the minority so-called \"Martial Races\", such as the Sikhs and the Gurkhas.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe inefficiencies of the old organisation, which had estranged sepoys from their British officers, were addressed, and the post-1857 units were mainly organised on the \"irregular\" system. From 1797 until the rebellion of 1857, each regular Bengal Native Infantry regiment had had 22 or 23 British officers,[36]:\\u200a238\\u200a who held every position of authority down to the second-in-command of each company. In irregular units there were fewer British officers, but they associated themselves far more closely with their soldiers, while more responsibility was given to the Indian officers.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe British increased the ratio of British to Indian soldiers within India. From 1861 Indian artillery was replaced by British units, except for a few mountain batteries.[36]:\\u200a319\\u200a The post-rebellion changes formed the basis of the military organisation of British India until the early 20th century.[citation needed]\\n\\nAwards\\n\\nVictoria Cross\\n\\nMedals were awarded to members of the British Armed Forces and the British Indian Army during the rebellion.

The Indian Order of Merit was the only gallantry medal available to Native soldiers between 1837 and 1907.[187]\\n\\nNomenclature\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nNames of the Indian Rebellion of 1857\\n\\nThere is no universally agreed name for the events of this period.\\n\\nIn India and Pakistan, it has been termed as the \"War of Independence of 1857\" or \"First War of Indian Independence\"[188] but it is not uncommon to use terms such as the \"Revolt of 1857\". The classification of the Rebellion being \"First War of Independence\" is not without its critics in India.[189][190][191][192] The use of the term \"Indian Mutiny\" is considered by some Indian politicians[193] as belittling the importance of what happened and therefore reflecting an imperialistic attitude. Others dispute this interpretation.[citation needed]\\n\\nIn the UK and parts of the Commonwealth it is commonly called the \"Indian Mutiny\", but terms such as \"Great Indian Mutiny\", the \"Sepoy Mutiny\", the \"Sepoy Rebellion\", the \"Sepoy War\", the \"Great Mutiny\", the \"Rebellion of 1857\", \"the Uprising\", the \"Mahomedan Rebellion\", and the \"Revolt of 1857\" have also been used.[194][195][196] \"The Indian Insurrection\" was a name used in the press of the UK and British colonies at the time.[197]\\n\\nHistoriography\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nPanic of 1857\\n\\nMutiny Memorial in Delhi, a monument to those killed on the British side during the fighting.\\n\\nMichael Adas (1971) examines the historiography with emphasis on the four major approaches: the Indian nationalist view; the Marxist analysis; the view of the Rebellion as a traditionalist rebellion; and intensive studies of local uprisings.[198] Many of the key primary and secondary sources appear in Biswamoy Pati, ed. 1857 Rebellion.[199][200]\\n\\nSuppression of the Indian Revolt by the English\\n\\nblowing from a gun by the British, a painting by\\n\\nVasily Vereshchagin\\n\\nc. 1884. Note: This painting was allegedly bought by the British crown and possibly destroyed (current whereabouts unknown). It anachronistically depicts the events of 1857 with soldiers wearing (then current) uniforms of the late 19th century.\\n\\nThomas R. Metcalf has stressed the importance of the work by Cambridge professor Eric Stokes (1924–1981), especially Stokes\\' The Peasant and the Raj: Studies in Agrarian Society and Peasant Rebellion in Colonial India (1978). Metcalf says Stokes undermines the assumption that 1857 was a response to general causes emanating from entire classes of people. Instead, Stokes argues that 1) those Indians who suffered the greatest relative deprivation rebelled and that 2) the decisive factor in precipitating a revolt was the presence of prosperous magnates who supported British rule. Stokes also explores issues of economic development, the nature of privileged landholding, the role of moneylenders, the usefulness of classical rent theory, and, especially, the notion of the \"rich peasant\".[201]\\n\\nTo Kim A. Wagner, who has conducted the most recent survey of the literature, modern Indian historiography is yet to move beyond responding to the \"prejudice\" of colonial accounts. Wagner sees no reason why atrocities committed by Indians should be understated or inflated merely because these things \"offend our post-colonial sensibilities\".[202]\\n\\nWagner also stresses the importance of William Dalrymple\\'s The Last Mughal: The Fall of a Dynasty, Delhi 1857. Dalrymple was assisted by Mahmood Farooqui, who translated key Urdu and Shikastah sources and published a selection in Besieged: Voices from Delhi 1857.[203] Dalrymple emphasized the role of religion and explored in detail the internal divisions and politico-religious discord amongst the rebels. He did not discover much in the way of proto-nationalism or any of the roots of modern India in the rebellion.[204][205] Sabbaq Ahmed has looked at the ways in which ideologies of royalism, militarism, and Jihad influenced the behaviour of contending Muslim factions.[206]\\n\\nAlmost from the moment the first sepoys mutinied in Meerut, the nature and the scope of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 has been contested and argued over. Speaking in the House of Commons in July 1857, Benjamin Disraeli labelled it a \\'national revolt\\' while Lord Palmerston, the Prime Minister, tried to downplay the scope and the significance of the event as a \\'mere military mutiny\\'.[207] Reflecting this debate, an early historian of the rebellion, Charles Ball, used the word mutiny in his title, but labelled it a \"struggle for liberty and independence as a people\" in the text.[208] Historians remain divided on whether the rebellion can properly be considered a war of Indian independence or not,[209] although it is popularly considered to be one in India. Arguments against include:\\n\\nA united India did not exist at that time in political, cultural, or ethnic terms;\\n\\nThe rebellion was put down with the help of other Indian soldiers drawn from the Madras Army, the Bombay Army and the Sikh regiments; 80% of the East India Company forces were Indian;[210]\\n\\nMany of the local rulers fought amongst themselves rather than uniting against the British;\\n\\nMany rebel Sepoy regiments disbanded and went home rather than fight;\\n\\nNot all of the rebels accepted the return of the Mughals;\\n\\nThe King of Delhi had no real control over the mutineers;[211]\\n\\nThe revolt was largely limited to north and central India. Whilst risings occurred elsewhere they had little impact because of their limited nature;\\n\\nA number of revolts occurred in areas not under British rule, and against native rulers, often as a result of local internal politics;\\n\\n\"The revolt was fractured along religious, ethnic and regional lines.[212]\\n\\nFelice Beato, 1857.\\n\\nA second school of thought while acknowledging the validity of the above-mentioned arguments opines that this rebellion may indeed be called a war of India\\'s independence. The reasons advanced are:\\n\\nEven though the rebellion had various causes, most of the rebel sepoys who were able to do so, made their way to Delhi to revive the old Mughal empire that signified national unity for even the Hindus amongst them;\\n\\nThere was a widespread popular revolt in many areas such as Awadh, Bundelkhand and Rohilkhand. The rebellion was therefore more than just a military rebellion, and it spanned more than one region;\\n\\nThe sepoys did not seek to revive small kingdoms in their regions, instead they repeatedly proclaimed a \"country-wide rule\" of the Mughals and vowed to drive out the British from \"India\", as they knew it then. (The sepoys ignored local princes and proclaimed in cities they took over: Khalq Khuda Ki, Mulk Badshah Ka, Hukm Subahdar Sipahi Bahadur Ka – \"the people belong to God, the country to the Emperor and authority to the Sepoy Commandant\"). The objective of driving out \"foreigners\" from not only one\\'s own area but from their conception of the entirety of \"India\", signifies a nationalist sentiment;\\n\\nThe mutineers, although some were recruited from outside Oudah, displayed a common purpose.[213]\\n\\n150th anniversary\\n\\nThe Government of India celebrated the year 2007 as the 150th anniversary of \"India\\'s First War of Independence\". Several books written by Indian authors were released in the anniversary year including Amresh Mishra\\'s \"War of Civilizations\", a controversial history of the Rebellion of 1857, and \"Recalcitrance\" by Anurag Kumar, one of the few novels written in English by an Indian based on the events of 1857.[citation needed]\\n\\nIn 2007, a group of retired British soldiers and civilians, some of them descendants of British soldiers who died in the conflict, attempted to visit the site of the Siege of Lucknow. However, fears of violence by Indian demonstrators, supported by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, prevented the British visitors from visiting the site.[214] Despite the protests, Sir Mark Havelock was able to make his way past police to visit the grave of his ancestor, General Henry Havelock.[215]\\n\\nIn popular culture\\n\\nFilms\\n\\nHenry Nelson O\\'Neil\\'s 1857 painting\\n\\nLight of India – A 1929 short American silent film directed by Elmer Clifton and filmed in Technicolor, depicts the rebellion.\\n\\nBengal Brigade – A 1954 film: at the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny.

They ... insisted on the clause that stated that the people of India would enjoy the same protection as all subjects of Britain. Over time, this royal intervention led to the Proclamation of 1858 becoming known in the Indian subcontinent as \\'the Magna Carta of Indian liberties\\', a phrase which Indian nationalists such as Gandhi later took up as they sought to test equality under imperial law\"[21]\\n\\n^ \"In purely legal terms, (the proclamation) kept faith with the principles of liberal imperialism and appeared to hold out the promise that British rule would benefit Indians and Britons alike.  But as is too often the case with noble statements of faith, reality fell far short of theory, and the failure on the part of the British to live up to the wording of the proclamation would later be used by Indian nationalists as proof of the hollowness of imperial principles.\"[22]\\n\\n^ \"Ignoring ...the conciliatory proclamation of Queen Victoria in 1858, Britishers in India saw little reason to grant Indians a greater control over their own affairs.

As I read about the events of 1857, I am forced to the conclusion that the Indian national character had sunk very low. The leaders of the revolt could never agree. They were mutually jealous and continually intrigued against one another. ... In fact these personal jealousies and intrigues were largely responsible for the Indian defeat.Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Surendranath Sen: Eighteen Fifty-seven (Appx. X & Appx.

Dyer , in charge of 51 soldiers of the 9th Gurkha Rifles and 54th Sikhs [5] [6]\\n\\nJallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the\\n\\nAmritsar massacre, took place on 13 April 1919. A large, peaceful crowd had gathered at the\\n\\nJallianwala Bagh in\\n\\nAmritsar,\\n\\nPunjab, British India, during the annual Baishakhi fair to protest against the\\n\\nRowlatt Act and the arrest of pro-independence activists\\n\\nSaifuddin Kitchlew and\\n\\nSatyapal. In response to the public gathering, the temporary\\n\\nbrigadier general\\n\\nR. E. H. Dyer surrounded the people with his Gurkha and Sikh infantry regiments of the\\n\\nBritish Indian Army.\\n\\n[7]\\n\\n[8]\\n\\n[1]\\n\\n[9]\\n\\n[10]\\n\\n[11]\\n\\nThe massacre caused a re-evaluation by the Imperial British military of its role when confronted with civilians to use \"minimal force whenever possible\" (although the British Army was not directly involved in the massacre; the British Indian Army was a separate organisation). However, in the light of later British military actions during the Mau Mau rebellion in the Kenya Colony, historian Huw Bennett has pointed out that this new policy was not always followed.[12] The army was retrained with less violent tactics for crowd control.[13]\\n\\nThe level of casual brutality and the lack of any accountability stunned the entire nation,[14] resulting in a wrenching loss of faith of the general Indian public in the intentions of the United Kingdom.[15] The attack was condemned by the Secretary of State for War, Winston Churchill, as \"unutterably monstrous\", and in the UK House of Commons debate on 8 July 1920 Members of Parliament voted 247 to 37 against Dyer. The ineffective inquiry, together with the initial accolades for Dyer, fuelled great widespread anger against the British among the Indian populace, leading to the non-cooperation movement of 1920–22.[16] Some historians consider the episode a decisive step towards the end of British rule in India.[17]\\n\\nBackground[edit]\\n\\nDefence of India Act[edit]\\n\\nMain article: \\n\\nDefence of India Act 1915\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nGhadar Mutiny\\n\\nDuring World War I, British India contributed to the British war effort by providing men and resources. Millions of Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while both the Indian administration and the princes sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. Bengal and Punjab remained sources of anti-colonial activities. Revolutionary attacks in Bengal, associated increasingly with disturbances in Punjab, were enough to nearly paralyse the regional administration.[18][19] Of these, a pan-Indian mutiny in the British Indian Army planned for February 1915 was the most prominent amongst a number of plots formulated between 1914 and 1917 by Indian nationalists in India, the United States and Germany.\\n\\nThe planned February mutiny was ultimately thwarted when British intelligence infiltrated the Ghadar Movement, arresting key figures. Mutinies in smaller units and garrisons within India were also crushed. In the context of the British war effort and the threat from the separatist movement in India, the Defence of India Act 1915 was passed, limiting civil and political liberties. Michael O\\'Dwyer, then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, was one of the strongest proponents of the act, in no small part due to the Ghadarite threat in the province.[20]\\n\\nThe Rowlatt Act[edit]\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nRowlatt Committee and\\n\\nRowlatt Act\\n\\nThe costs of the protracted war in money and manpower were great. High casualty rates in the war, increasing inflation after the end, compounded by heavy taxation, the deadly 1918 flu pandemic, and the disruption of trade during the war escalated human suffering in India. The pre-war Indian nationalist sentiment was revived as moderate and extremist groups of the Indian National Congress ended their differences to unify. In 1916, the Congress was successful in establishing the Lucknow Pact, a temporary alliance with the All-India Muslim League. British political concessions and Whitehall\\'s India Policy after World War I began to change, with the passage of Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms, which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917.[21][22][23] However, this was deemed insufficient in reforms by the Indian political movement. Mahatma Gandhi, recently returned to India, began emerging as an increasingly charismatic leader under whose leadership civil disobedience movements grew rapidly as an expression of political unrest.[24]\\n\\nThe recently crushed Ghadar conspiracy, the presence of Raja Mahendra Pratap\\'s Kabul mission in Afghanistan (with possible links to Bolshevik Russia), and a still-active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal (as well as worsening civil unrest throughout India) led to the appointment of a sedition committee in 1918 chaired by Sidney Rowlatt, an Anglo-Egyptian judge. It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal. On the recommendations of the committee, the Rowlatt Act, an extension of the Defence of India Act 1915 to limit civil liberties, was enacted.[20][25][26][27][28]\\n\\nThe passage of the Rowlatt Act in 1919 caused large-scale political unrest throughout India. Ominously, in 1919, the Third Anglo-Afghan War began in the wake of Amir Habibullah\\'s assassination and the institution of Amanullah Khan in his place. As a reaction to the Rowlatt Act, Muhammad Ali Jinnah resigned from his Bombay seat, writing in a letter to the Viceroy, \"I, therefore, as a protest against the passing of the Bill and the manner in which it was passed tender my resignation ... a Government that passes or sanctions such a law in times of peace forfeits its claim to be called a civilised government\".[29] Gandhi\\'s call for protest against the Rowlatt Act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests.\\n\\nBefore the massacre[edit]\\n\\nEspecially in Punjab, the situation was deteriorating rapidly, with disruptions of rail, telegraph, and communication systems. The movement was at its peak before the end of the first week of April, with some recording that \"practically the whole of Lahore was on the streets, the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali Bazaar was estimated to be around 20,000\".[30] Many officers in the Indian army believed revolt was possible, and they prepared for the worst. The British Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, Michael O\\'Dwyer, is said to have believed that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated revolt planned around May, on the lines of the 1857 revolt, at a time when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer.[31]\\n\\nThe Amritsar massacre, and other events at about the same time, have been described by some historians as the result of a concerted plan by the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy.[32] James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have posited a direct causal relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tense situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre.[33]\\n\\nOn 10 April 1919, there was a protest at the residence of Miles Irving, the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar. The demonstration was to demand the release of two popular leaders of the Indian Independence Movement, Satyapal and Saifuddin Kitchlew, who had been arrested by the government and moved to a secret location. Both were proponents of the Satyagraha movement led by Gandhi. A military picket shot at the crowd, killing several protesters and setting off a series of violent events. Riotous crowds carried out arson attacks on British banks, killed several British people and assaulted two British women.[34]\\n\\nOn 11 April, Marcella Sherwood, an elderly English missionary, fearing for the safety of the approximately 600 Indian children under her care, was on her way to shut the schools and send the children home.[35][36] While travelling through a narrow street called the Kucha Kurrichhan, she was caught by a mob who violently attacked her. She was rescued by some local Indians, including the father of one of her pupils, who hid her from the mob and then smuggled her to the safety of Gobindgarh Fort.[36][37] After visiting Sherwood on 19 April, the local commander of Indian Army forces, Brigadier General Dyer, enraged at the assault, issued an order requiring every Indian man using that street to crawl its length on his hands and knees as a punishment.[35][38] Dyer later explained to a British inspector: \"Some Indians crawl face downwards in front of their gods. I wanted them to know that a British woman is as sacred as a Hindu god and therefore they have to crawl in front of her, too.\"[39] He also authorised the indiscriminate public whipping of locals who came within lathi length of a police officer. Marcella Sherwood later defended Dyer, describing him as \"the saviour of the Punjab\".[38]\\n\\nFor the next two days, the city of Amritsar was quiet, but violence continued in other parts of Punjab. Railway lines were cut, telegraph posts destroyed, government buildings burnt, and three Europeans murdered. By 13 April, the British government had decided to put most of Punjab under martial law. The legislation restricted a number of civil liberties, including freedom of assembly; gatherings of more than four people were banned.[40]\\n\\nOn the evening of 12 April, the leaders of the hartal in Amritsar held a meeting at the Hindu College–Dhab Khatikan. At the meeting, Hans Raj, an aide to Kitchlew, announced a public protest meeting would be held at 16:30 the following day in the Jallianwala Bagh, to be organised by Muhammad Bashir and chaired by a senior and respected Congress Party leader, Lal Kanhyalal Bhatia. A series of resolutions protesting against the Rowlatt Act, the recent actions of the British authorities and the detention of Satyapal and Kitchlew was drawn up and approved, after which the meeting adjourned.[41]\\n\\nThe massacre[edit]\\n\\n[42]\\n\\nOn Sunday, 13 April 1919, Dyer, convinced a major insurrection could take place, banned all meetings. This notice was not widely disseminated, and many villagers gathered in the Bagh to celebrate the Baisakhi festival and to peacefully protest against the arrest and deportation of two national leaders, Satyapal and Saifuddin Kitchlew.[43]\\n\\nAt 09:00 on the morning of 13 April 1919, the traditional festival of Baisakhi, Dyer proceeded through Amritsar with several city officials, announcing the implementation of a pass system to enter or leave the city, a curfew beginning at 20:00 that night, and a ban on all processions and public meetings of four or more persons. The proclamation was read and explained in English, Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi, but many either paid it no heed or learned of it only later.[44] Meanwhile, local police had received intelligence of the planned meeting in the Jallianwala Bagh through word of mouth and plainclothes detectives in the crowds. Dyer was informed of the meeting at 12:40 and returned to his base at around 13:30 to decide how to handle it.[45]\\n\\nBy mid-afternoon, thousands of Indians had gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh (garden) near the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar. Many who were present had been worshipping earlier at the Golden Temple and were merely passing through the Bagh on their way home. The Bagh was (and remains today) an open area of 6–7 acres (2.4–2.8\\xa0ha), roughly 200 by 200 yards (180\\xa0m ×\\xa0180\\xa0m) in size, and surrounded on all sides by walls roughly 10 feet (3.0\\xa0m) in height. Balconies of houses three to four stories tall overlooked the Bagh, and five narrow entrances opened onto it, several with lockable gates. Although it was planted with crops during the rainy season, for much of the rest of the year it served as a local meeting place and recreation area.[46] In the centre of the Bagh was a samadhi (cremation site) and a large well partly filled with water which measured about 20 feet (6.1\\xa0m) in diameter.[46]\\n\\nApart from the pilgrims passing through, Amritsar had filled up over the preceding days with farmers, traders, and merchants who were attending the annual Baisakhi horse and cattle fair. Because the city police closed the fair at 14:00 that afternoon, many of those who had been attending it drifted into the Jallianwala Bagh, further increasing the number of people who happened to be there when the massacre began.\\n\\nDyer arranged for an aeroplane to overfly the Bagh and estimate the size of the crowd, which he reported was about 6,000; however, the Hunter Commission estimates that a crowd of between 10,000 and 20,000 had assembled by the time Dyer arrived.[46][9] Dyer and Deputy Commissioner Irving, the senior civil authority for Amritsar, took no actions to prevent the crowds from assembling or to  disperse them peacefully. This would later be a serious criticism levelled at both Dyer and Irving.\\n\\nAn hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 17:30, Dyer arrived at the Bagh with a group of 50 troops. All fifty were armed with .303 Lee–Enfield bolt-action rifles. Dyer may have specifically chosen troops from the Gurkha and Sikh ethnic groups due to their proven loyalty to the British. He had also brought two armoured cars armed with machine guns; however, the vehicles could not enter the compound through the narrow entrances. The Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had only five narrow entrances, most of which were kept permanently locked. The main entrance was relatively wide, but was guarded heavily by the troops backed by the armoured vehicles so as to prevent anyone from getting out.\\n\\nWithout warning the crowd to disperse, Dyer ordered his troops to block the main exits and begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd in front of the available narrow exits, where panicked crowds were trying to leave the Bagh. Firing continued for approximately ten minutes. Unarmed civilians, including men, women, elderly people and children were killed. This incident came to be known as the Amritsar massacre. A cease-fire was ordered after the troops fired about one third of their ammunition.[47][48] He stated later that the purpose of this action \"was not to disperse the meeting but to punish the Indians for disobedience.\"[49]\\n\\nThe following day Dyer stated in a report, \"I have heard that between 200 and 300 of the crowd were killed. My party fired 1,650 rounds\".[50][47] Apart from the many deaths that resulted directly from the shooting, a number of people died by being crushed in the stampedes at the narrow gates or by jumping into the solitary well on the compound to escape the shooting. A plaque, placed at the site after independence, states that 120 bodies were removed from the well. Dyer imposed a curfew time that was earlier than the usual time; as a result, the wounded could not be moved from where they had fallen, and many of them therefore died of their wounds during the night.[51]\\n\\nCasualties[edit]\\n\\nThe number of total casualties is disputed. The following morning\\'s newspapers quoted an erroneous initial figure of 200 casualties, offered by the Associated Press, e.g.,\\n\\n\"News has been received from the Punjab that the Amritsar mob has again broken out in a violent attack against the authorities. The rebels were repulsed by the military and they suffered 200 casualties.\"\\n\\n—\\u200a\\n\\n[52]\\n\\nThe Government of Punjab, criticised by the Hunter Commission for not gathering accurate figures, only offered the same approximate figure of 200. When interviewed by the members of the committee a senior civil servant in Punjab admitted that the actual figure could be higher.[9] The Sewa Samiti society independently carried out an investigation and reported 379 deaths, and 192 seriously wounded. The Hunter Commission based their figures of 379 deaths, and approximately 3 times that number injured, suggesting 1,500 casualties.[9] At the meeting of the Imperial Legislative Council held on 12 September 1919, the investigation led by Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya concluded that there were 42 boys among the dead, the youngest of them only 7 months old.[53] The Hunter commission confirmed the deaths of 337 men, 41 boys and a six-week-old baby.[9]\\n\\nIn July 1919, three months after the massacre, officials were tasked with finding who had been killed by inviting inhabitants of the city to volunteer information about those who had died.[9] This information was incomplete due to fear that those who participated would be identified as having been present at the meeting, and some of the dead may not have had close relations in the area.[54]\\n\\nWinston Churchill reported nearly 400 slaughtered, and three or four times the number wounded to the Westminster Parliament, on 8 July 1920.[55]\\n\\nSince the official figures were obviously flawed regarding the size of the crowd (6,000–20,000[9]), the number of rounds fired and the period of shooting, the Indian National Congress instituted a separate inquiry of its own, with conclusions that differed considerably from the British Government\\'s inquiry. The casualty number quoted by the Congress was more than 1,500, with approximately 1,000 being killed.[2]\\n\\nIndian nationalist Swami Shraddhanand wrote to Gandhi of 1,500 deaths in the incident.[56]\\n\\nThe British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre,[57] but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.[58][59][60]\\n\\nAftermath[edit]\\n\\nThis event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their previous loyalty to the British and become nationalists distrustful of British rule.[61] Afghanistan then invaded British India.\\n\\nDyer reported to his superiors that he had been \"confronted by a revolutionary army\", to which Major General William Beynon replied via telegram: \"Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves.\"[62] O\\'Dwyer requested that martial law should be imposed upon Amritsar and other areas, and this was granted by Viceroy Lord Chelmsford.[63][64] Thousands were detained in the subsequent days, some being sentenced to penal transportation. According to historian Harish Puri, at least 115 people were killed by security forces in the days after 13 April.[65]\\n\\nBoth Secretary of State for War Winston Churchill and former Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as \"unutterably monstrous\" and Asquith calling it \"one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history\".[66] In the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, Churchill said, \"The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything ... When fire had been opened upon it to disperse it, it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides. Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.\"[67]\\n\\nAfter Churchill\\'s speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.[68] Cloake reports that despite the official rebuke, many Britons still \"thought him a hero for saving the rule of British law in India.\"[69]\\n\\nRabindranath Tagore received the news of the massacre by 22 May 1919. He tried to arrange a protest meeting in Calcutta and finally decided to renounce his British knighthood as \"a symbolic act of protest\".[70] In the repudiation letter, dated 31 May 1919 and addressed to the Viceroy of India, Lord Chelmsford, he wrote \"I ... wish to stand, shorn, of all special distinctions, by the side of those of my countrymen who, for their so called insignificance, are liable to suffer degradation not fit for human beings.\"[71]\\n\\nGupta describes Tagore\\'s letter as \"historic\". He writes that Tagore \"renounced his knighthood in protest against the inhuman cruelty of the British Army to the people of Punjab\". Gupta quotes from Tagore\\'s letter to the Viceroy, stating \"The enormity of the measures taken by the Government in Punjab for quelling some local disturbances has, with a rude shock, revealed to our minds the helplessness of our position as British subjects in India ... [T]he very least that I can do for my country is to take all consequences upon myself in giving voice to the protest of the millions of my countrymen, surprised into dumb anguish of terror. The time has come when badges of honour make our shame glaring in the incongruous context of humiliation ...\"[72] English Writings of Rabindranath Tagore Miscellaneous Writings Vol # 8 carries a facsimile of this hand written letter.[73]\\n\\nDisorders Inquiry Committee 1919–1920 (report) Calcutta- Superintendent Government Printing, India 1920\\n\\nHunter Commission[edit]\\n\\nOn 14 October 1919, after orders issued by the Secretary of State for India Edwin Montagu, the Government of India announced the formation of a committee of inquiry into the events in Punjab. Referred to as the Disorders Inquiry Committee, it was later more widely known as the Hunter Commission. It was named after the chairman, William, Lord Hunter, former Solicitor-General for Scotland and Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland. The stated purpose of the commission was to \"investigate the recent disturbances in Bombay, Delhi and Punjab, about their causes, and the measures taken to cope with them\".[74][75] The members of the commission were:\\n\\nLord Hunter, chairman of the commission\\n\\nMr Justice George C. Rankin of Calcutta\\n\\nSir Chimanlal Harilal Setalvad, vice-chancellor of Bombay University and advocate of the Bombay High Court\\n\\nW.F. Rice, member of the Home Department\\n\\nMajor-General George Barrow, KCB, KCMG, GOC Peshawar Division\\n\\nPandit Jagat Narayan, lawyer and member of the Legislative Council of the United Provinces\\n\\nThomas Smith, member of the Legislative Council of the United Provinces\\n\\nSardar Sahibzada Sultan Ahmad Khan, lawyer from Gwalior State\\n\\nH.C. Stokes, secretary of the Commission and member of the Home Department[75]\\n\\nAfter meeting in New Delhi on 29 October, the commission took statements from witnesses over the following weeks.[76] Witnesses were called in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bombay, and Lahore. Although the commission as such was not a formally constituted court of law, meaning witnesses were not subject to questioning under oath, its members managed to elicit detailed accounts and statements from witnesses by rigorous cross-questioning. In general, it was felt the commission had been very thorough in its enquiries.[75] After reaching Lahore in November, the commission wound up its initial inquiries by examining the principal witnesses to the events in Amritsar. The commission held its official sittings at the Lahore Town Hall near Anarkali Bazaar.\\n\\nOn 19 November, Dyer was ordered to appear before the commission. Although his military superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone.[75] Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He said that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Dyer told the commission, \"I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing, but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.\"[77] Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of \"rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well\".[75]\\n\\nAfter Mr. Justice Rankin had questioned Dyer, Sir Chimanlal Setalvad enquired:\\n\\nSir Chimanlal: Supposing the passage was sufficient to allow the armoured cars to go in, would you have opened fire with the machine guns?\\n\\nDyer: I think probably, yes.\\n\\nSir Chimanlal: In that case, the casualties would have been much higher?\\n\\nDyer: Yes.[75]\\n\\nDyer further stated that his intentions had been to strike terror throughout Punjab and in doing so, to reduce the moral stature of the \"rebels\". He said he did not stop the shooting when the crowd began to disperse because he thought it was his duty to keep shooting until the crowd was dispersed fully, and he believed that minimal shooting would not prove effective. In fact, he continued the shooting until the ammunition was almost exhausted.[78] He stated that he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the shooting: \"Certainly not. It was not my job. Hospitals were open and they could have gone there.\"[79]\\n\\nExhausted from the rigorous cross-examination questioning and unwell, Dyer was then released. Over the next several months, while the commission wrote its final report, the British press, as well as many MPs, turned increasingly hostile towards Dyer as the full extent of the massacre and his statements at the inquiry became widely known.[75] Lord Chelmsford refused to comment until the commission had been wound up. In the meanwhile, Dyer became seriously ill with jaundice and arteriosclerosis, and he was hospitalised.[75]\\n\\nAlthough the members of the commission were divided by racial tensions following Dyer\\'s statement, and though the Indian members decided to write a separate minority report, the commission\\'s final report, comprising six volumes of evidence and released on 8 March 1920, unanimously condemned Dyer\\'s actions:[75] In \"continuing firing as long as he did, it appears to us that General Dyer committed a grave error.\"[80] Dissenting members argued that the martial law regime\\'s use of force was wholly unjustified. \"General Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Sir Michael O\\'Dwyer was of the same view\", they wrote, \"[but] there was no rebellion which required to be crushed.\"\\n\\nThe commission\\'s report concluded that:\\n\\nLack of notice to disperse from the Bagh, in the beginning, was an error.\\n\\nThe length of firing showed a grave error.\\n\\nDyer\\'s motive of producing a sufficient moral effect was to be condemned.\\n\\nDyer had overstepped the bounds of his authority.\\n\\nThere had been no conspiracy to overthrow British rule in the Punjab.\\n\\nThe minority report of the Indian members further added that:\\n\\nProclamations banning public meetings were insufficiently distributed.\\n\\nInnocent people were in the crowd, and there had been no violence in the Bagh beforehand.\\n\\nDyer should have either ordered his troops to help the wounded or instructed the civil authorities to do so.\\n\\nDyer\\'s actions had been \"inhuman and un-British\" and had greatly injured the image of British rule in India.\\n\\nThe Hunter Commission did not impose any penal or disciplinary action because Dyer\\'s actions were condoned by various superiors (later upheld by the Army Council).[81] The Legal and Home Members on the Viceroy\\'s Executive Council ultimately decided that, though Dyer had acted in a callous and brutal way, military or legal prosecution would not be possible due to political reasons. However, he was finally found guilty of a mistaken notion of duty and relieved of his command on 23 March. He had been recommended for a CBE as a result of his service in the Third Afghan War; this recommendation was cancelled on 29 March 1920.\\n\\nReginald Dyer was disciplined by removal from his appointment, was passed over for promotion and was prohibited from employment in India. He died in 1927.[82]\\n\\nRioting in Gujranwala[edit]\\n\\nTwo days after the massacre, on 15 April 1919, riots occurred in Gujranwala protesting against the killings at Amritsar. Police and aircraft were used against the demonstrators, resulting in 12 deaths and 27 injuries. The officer commanding the Royal Air Force in India, Brigadier General N D K MacEwen, later stated that:\\n\\nI think we can fairly claim to have been of great use in the late riots, particularly at Gujranwala, where the crowd when looking at its nastiest was absolutely dispersed by a machine using bombs and Lewis guns.[83]\\n\\nAssassination of Michael O\\'Dwyer[edit]\\n\\nSee also: \\n\\nUdham Singh\\n\\nMichael O\\'Dwyer c. 1912\\n\\nOn 13 March 1940, at Caxton Hall in London, Udham Singh, an Indian independence activist from Sunam who had witnessed the events in Amritsar and who had been wounded there, shot and killed Michael O\\'Dwyer, the lieutenant-governor of Punjab at the time of the massacre, who had approved Dyer\\'s action and was believed to have been the main planner.\\n\\nSome, such as the nationalist newspaper Amrita Bazar Patrika, made statements supporting the killing. The common people and revolutionaries glorified the action of Udham Singh. Much of the press worldwide recalled the story of Jallianwala Bagh and alleged that O\\'Dwyer was responsible for the massacre. Singh was termed a \"fighter for freedom\" and his action was referred to in The Times newspaper as \"an expression of the pent-up fury of the down-trodden Indian People\".[84] Reporter and historian William L. Shirer wrote the next day, \"Most of the ... Indians I know [other than Gandhi] will feel this is divine retribution. O\\'Dwyer bore a share of responsibility in the 1919 Amritsar massacre, in which Gen. Dyer shot 1,500 Indians in cold blood. When I was at Amritsar eleven years after [the massacre] in 1930, the bitterness still stuck in the people there.\"[85]\\n\\nIn fascist countries, the incident was used for anti-British propaganda: Bergeret, published in large scale from Rome at that time, while commenting upon the Caxton Hall assassination, ascribed the greatest significance to the circumstance and praised the action of Sardar Udham Singh as courageous.[86] The Berliner Börsen Zeitung termed the event \"The torch of Indian freedom\". German radio reportedly broadcast: \"The cry of tormented people spoke with shots.\"\\n\\nJallianwala Bagh memorial\\n\\nAt a public meeting in Cawnpore (now Kanpur), a spokesman stated that \"at last an insult and humiliation of the nation had been avenged\". Similar sentiments were expressed in numerous other places across the country.[87] Fortnightly reports of the political situation in Bihar mentioned: \"It is true that we had no love lost for Sir Michael. The indignities he heaped upon our countrymen in Punjab have not been forgotten.\" In its 18 March 1940 issue Amrita Bazar Patrika wrote: \"O\\'Dwyer\\'s name is connected with Punjab incidents which India will never forget.\" The New Statesman observed: \"British conservatism has not discovered how to deal with Ireland after two centuries of rule. Similar comment may be made on British rule in India. Will the historians of the future have to record that it was not the Nazis but the British ruling class which destroyed the British Empire?\"\\n\\nSingh told the court at his trial:\\n\\nI did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to wreak vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of death. I am dying for my country. I have seen my people starving in India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the sake of my motherland?[88]\\n\\nSingh was hanged for the murder on 31 July 1940. At that time, many, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi, condemned the murder as senseless even if it was courageous. In 1952, Nehru (by then Prime Minister) honoured Udham Singh with the following statement, which appeared in the daily Partap:\\n\\nI salute Shaheed-i-Azam Udham Singh with reverence who had kissed the noose so that we may be free.\\n\\nSoon after this recognition by the Prime Minister, Udham Singh received the title of Shaheed, a name given to someone who has attained martyrdom or done something heroic on behalf of their country or religion.\\n\\nMonument and legacy[edit]\\n\\nJallianwala Bagh\\n\\nBullet marks, visible on preserved walls, at present-day Jallianwala Bagh\\n\\nA trust was founded in 1920 to build a memorial at the site after a resolution was passed by the Indian National Congress. In 1923, the trust purchased land for the project. A memorial, designed by American architect Benjamin Polk, was built on the site and inaugurated by President of India Rajendra Prasad on 13 April 1961, in the presence of Jawaharlal Nehru and other leaders. A flame later was added to the site.\\n\\nThe bullet marks remain on the walls and adjoining buildings to this day. The well into which many people jumped and drowned attempting to save themselves from the bullets is also a protected monument inside the park.\\n\\nFormation of the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee[edit]\\n\\nShortly after the massacre, the official Sikh clergy of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) in Amritsar conferred upon Dyer the Saropa (the mark of distinguished service to the Sikh faith or, in general, humanity), sending shock waves among the Sikh community.[89] On 12 October 1920, students and faculty of the Amritsar Khalsa College called a meeting to strengthen the Nationalistic Movement.[89] The students pushed for an anti-British movement and the result was the formation of the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee on 15 November 1920 to manage and to implement reforms in Sikh shrines.[90]\\n\\nVisit by Queen Elizabeth II[edit]\\n\\nAlthough Queen Elizabeth II had not made any comments on the incident during her state visits in 1961 and 1983, she spoke about the events at a state banquet in India on 13 October 1997:[91]\\n\\nIt is no secret that there have been some difficult episodes in our past – Jallianwala Bagh, which I shall visit tomorrow, is a distressing example. But history cannot be rewritten, however much we might sometimes wish otherwise. It has its moments of sadness, as well as gladness. We must learn from the sadness and build on the gladness.[91]\\n\\nWhile some Indians welcomed the expression of regret and sadness in the Queen\\'s statement, others criticised it for being less than an apology.[91] Prime Minister of India Inder Kumar Gujral defended the Queen, saying that she had not even been born at the time of the events and should not be required to apologise.[91]\\n\\nOn 14 October 1997, the Queen visited Jallianwala Bagh and paid her respects with a 30‑second moment of silence. During the visit, she wore a dress of a colour described as pink apricot or saffron, which is of religious significance to Hindus and Sikhs, as well as one of the colours on India\\'s flag.[91] She removed her shoes while visiting the monument and laid a wreath of marigolds in memorial.[91]\\n\\nDuring her visit to the monument, there were protests in the city of Amritsar, with people waving black flags and chanting \"Queen, go back.\"[92] Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip merely signed the visitor\\'s book; the fact that they did not leave any comment regretting the incident was criticised.[93][94]\\n\\nDuring the same visit, Philip and his guide Partha Sarathi Mukherjee came to a plaque stating that \"about two thousand Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims ... were martyred in a non-violent struggle\" at the site.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a bit exaggerated,\" Philip asserted, \"it must include the wounded.\" Mukherjee\\xa0 ... asked Philip how he had come to this conclusion. \"I was told about the killings by General Dyer\\'s son,\" Mukherjee recalls the Duke as saying, \"I\\'d met him while I was in the Navy.\"[95]\\n\\nThese statements by Philip drew widespread condemnation in India.[95][94][96][97] Indian journalist Praveen Swami wrote in Frontline magazine:[95]\\n\\nThat [this was] the solitary comment Prince Philip had to offer after his visit to Jallianwala Bagh[,] ... [and] the only aspect of the massacre that exercised his imagination, caused offence. It suggested that the death of 379 people was in some way inadequate to appall the royal conscience, in the way the death of 2,000 people would have. Perhaps more important of all, the staggering arrogance that Prince Philip displayed in citing his source of information on the tragedy made clear the lack of integrity in the wreath-laying.\\n\\nDemands for an apology[edit]\\n\\nThere are long-standing demands in India that Britain should apologise for the massacre.[95][94][98][93] Winston Churchill, on 8 July 1920, urged the House of Commons to punish Dyer.[67] Churchill, who described the massacre as \"monstrous\",[99] succeeded in persuading the House to forcibly retire Dyer but would have preferred to have seen him disciplined.[68]\\n\\nAn apology of sorts was made at the time in a statement by Sir William Vincent, the home member of the Viceroy\\'s Council, during a debate on the Punjab disturbances. This statement expressed the deep regret of the Government of India and made clear that the actions taken were wrong and repudiated by the government.  Vincent said that \"overdrastic and severe action, excessive use of force and acts ... reasonably interpreted as designed to humiliate Indian people ... cannot but be regarded as unpardonable (and) morally indefensible.\" In addition, the Indian Government reported in despatches to the UK government that Dyer\\'s actions were far beyond what was necessary and violated the principle of using reasonable and minimum force. A manual was created after the massacre to instruct officers in their use of force, which was to be avoided unless absolutely necessary.[100]\\n\\nIn February 2013 David Cameron became the first serving British prime minister to visit the site; he laid a wreath at the memorial and described the Amritsar massacre as \"a deeply shameful event in British history, one that Winston Churchill rightly described at that time as monstrous. We must never forget what happened here and we must ensure that the UK stands up for the right of peaceful protests\". Cameron did not deliver an official apology.[101] This was criticised by some commentators. Writing in The Telegraph, Sankarshan Thakur stated: \"Over nearly a century now British protagonists have approached the 1919 massacre ground of Jallianwala Bagh thumbing the thesaurus for an appropriate word to pick. \\'Sorry\\' has not been among them.\"[94]\\n\\nJallianwala Bagh memorial\\n\\nThe issue of apology resurfaced during the 2016 India visit of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and the Duchess of Cambridge when both decided to skip the memorial site from their itinerary.[102] In 2017, Indian author and politician Shashi Tharoor suggested that the Jalianwala Bagh centenary in 2019 could be a \"good time\" for the British to apologise to the Indians for wrongs committed during the colonial rule.[103][98] Visiting the memorial on 6 December 2017, London\\'s mayor Sadiq Khan called on the British government to apologise for the massacre.[104]\\n\\nIn February 2019, the British House of Lords began discussing and debating the massacre.[105]\\n\\nOn 12 April 2019, a ceremony was held in Amritsar just before the centenary anniversary of the massacre. Although she did not issue an apology, British Prime Minister Theresa May called the 1919 shooting of unarmed civilians a \"shameful scar\", echoing the 2013 statement made by David Cameron.[106]\\n\\nNational memorial event in the UK[edit]\\n\\nOn 15 April 2019, a national memorial event titled \"Jallianwala Bagh 100 Years On\" was held in the British Parliament, hosted by Jasvir Singh and organised by City Sikhs and the Faiths Forum for London. Testimonies of survivors were read from the book Eyewitness at Amritsar.[107] There were traditional musical performances, and a minute\\'s silence was held to remember those who had been killed a century earlier.[108]\\n\\nThe Asian Awards[edit]\\n\\nIn April 2019 The Asian Awards honoured the Martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh with the prestigious Founders Award. It was accepted by the nephew of Bhagat Singh, Jagmohan Singh.[109]\\n\\n2021 assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth II[edit]\\n\\nOn Christmas Day, 2021, Jaswant Singh Chail entered the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Queen Elizabeth II was living, intending to assassinate her with a crossbow. In a video he posted to Snapchat, he said \"This is revenge for those who have died in the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre. It is also revenge for those who have been killed, humiliated and discriminated on because of their race\". He was arrested before entering the castle, and in February 2023, admitted three counts of treason, the first charge of treason in the UK since 1981.\\n\\nIn a televised hearing Mr Justice Hilliard sentenced Chail to nine years with a further five years on extended licence. Under the hybrid order, Chail will be transferred from Broadmoor psychiatric hospital to serve his sentence in prison when he is well enough.[110]\\n\\nArts and representations[edit]\\n\\nThis article may contain irrelevant references to popular culture .

Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:'), llm=HuggingFaceEndpoint(repo_id='mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1', max_new_tokens=64, repetition_penalty=1.03, model='mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1', client=<InferenceClient(model='mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1', timeout=120)>, async_client=<InferenceClient(model='mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1', timeout=120)>, task='text-generation')), document_prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['page_content', 'source'], template='Content: {page_content}\\nSource: {source}'), document_variable_name='summaries')), document_variable_name='context'), retriever=VectorStoreRetriever(tags=['FAISS', 'HuggingFaceEmbeddings'], vectorstore=<langchain_community.vectorstores.faiss.FAISS object at 0x7dbf58738910>))"
